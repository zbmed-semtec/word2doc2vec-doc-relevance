# word2doc2vec-doc-relevance
An approach exploring and assessing literature-based doc-2-doc recommendations using word2vec combined with doc2vec, and applying it to TREC and RELISH datasets

# word2vec embeddings
We used the gensim word2vec model [glove-wiki-gigaword-200](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) as the default model for pre-trained word embeddings.
This can also be replaced by your own model given two .txt files, one of which contains line separated terms for the plaintext words and the other line separated word vectors,
where each dimension is separated by space.

# document embeddings
The document embeddings are generated by calculating the centroids of all given word embeddings in each title and abstract document. We added the configurability to change the weight of the title and abstracts, as an abstract may contain more detailed information than the title and can as such be weighted more heavily for the resulting document embedding of an article.
