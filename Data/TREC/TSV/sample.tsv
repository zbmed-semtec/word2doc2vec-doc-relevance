11084459	[Gene therapy and ovarian cancer: update of clinical trials].	Ovarian cancer is the first leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer. Advances in therapy are needed to obtain complete response after surgery and/or chemotherapy. Gene therapy is a new alternative therapeutic approach. 380 gene therapy clinical trials (3173 patients) are going to be assessed. 63% of these trials concern therapy of cancer. 16 gene therapy clinical trails are applied to ovarian cancer. These 16 clinical trials assess different treatment strategies: Mutation compensation by replacement of an altered tumor suppressor gene (p53, BRCA1); Molecular chemotherapy by transfer of a suicide gene (HSV-tk gene); Antitumoral immunotherapy by cytokine gene transfer (IL2, IL12); Oncogene inhibition (erb-B2 gene); Multi Drug Resistance gene transfer. A knowledge of basis concepts of gene transfer strategies, is needed to understand these different treatment strategies. Thus, the goals of this review are, first, to provide the basis concepts of gene transfer strategies to the obstetrician-gynecologist and second, to submit recent gene therapy clinical trials about ovarian cancer.
11092520	Tumor necrosis factor-beta gene NcoI polymorphism decreases insulin resistance in Japanese men.	Given that the NcoI polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta) gene has been shown to be associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretory capacity, we know that this TNF-beta gene polymorphism may influence insulin resistance. In Caucasians, 2 polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha promoter region (positions -308 and -238) have been reported to be associated with insulin resistance. Thus, we investigated how genetic variation in the TNF-beta and TNF-alpha genes was associated with insulin resistance in 211 Japanese men. The frequency of the TNF-beta gene polymorphism was 0.41, and insulin resistance, estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), was significantly lower in variant homozygotes versus wild-type allele. The frequencies of the -308 and -238 polymorphisms were 0.01 and 0.02, respectively, and these polymorphisms were not associated with insulin resistance. Our results suggest that the TNF-beta gene polymorphism decreases insulin resistance, and that the -308 and -238 polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha promoter region are not a major contributing factor to insulin resistance in Japanese men.
11096354	Endocrine therapies for patients with recurrent breast cancer: predictive factors for responses to first- and second-line endocrine therapies.	Breast cancer patients have been treated with four different hormonal agents, antiestrogen, progestin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and aromatase inhibitor, during the past 7 years in Japan. To investigate the efficacy of these agents for the treatment of recurrent breast cancer patients, we conducted a retrospective multi-institute survey in Japan. The clinico-pathological data of 131 patients, who received endocrine therapy as first-line treatment between 1993 and 1998, were collected from seven institutes. The median age of the patients was 55 (range 27-92) years, 75% of their primary tumors were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or unknown, and 95% of the dominant metastatic sites were bone, soft tissue or lungs. The objective response rate to first-line endocrine therapy was 42.7%, and that to second-line therapy 42.5% (17 of 40 patients). Multiple regression analyses of predictive factors for a response to first- and second-line endocrine therapies indicated two independent factors, ER status of the primary tumors and dominant site of metastasis, for the former, and one independent factor, a response to first-line endocrine therapy, for the latter. Analysis of relationships between sequences of use of hormonal agents and objective response rates revealed that the choice of first-line hormonal agent did not influence the overall efficacy of first- and second-line endocrine therapies. Overall survival after first recurrence in patients with tumors exhibiting an objective response or stable disease to first-line endocrine therapy was significantly better than that in patients with tumors exhibiting progressive disease (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that an adequate selection of recurrent breast cancer patients referring the ER status, dominant site of metastasis and a prior response to endocrine therapy may contribute to better clinical outcomes of the patients.
11111007	Impaired neural regulation of insulin secretion related to the leptin receptor gene mutation in Wistar fatty rats.	The Wistar fatty (WF) rat is a model of obese Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). These rats were bred by crossing Zucker fatty (ZF) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. A homo-allelic leptin receptor gene mutation has been reported in ZF rats. We report here how these genetic factors contribute to plasma insulin regulation. The fasting plasma insulin levels were higher in WKY and Wistar lean (WL) rats than in Zucker lean (ZL) rats (p<0.05). The levels in WF and ZF rats were higher than in their respective lean littermates, WL and ZL rats (p<0.05). After intragastric glucose load, the plasma insulin increase was reduced upon pretreatment by intracerebroventricular (i. c.v.) methylatropine (an antagonist of the cholinergic receptor) injection in WL rats (p<0.05) but not in WF rats. Plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response to intragastric glucose load was not affected by methylatropine. After selective hepatic-vagotomy, plasma insulin levels increased in wild-type ZL rats (p<0.05). This increase was not observed in heterozygote ZL rats. Surprisingly, this response of plasma insulin was not shown in wild-type WL and WKY rats. ZF and WF rats did show a prominent decrease in insulin response (p<0.05). These results indicate that the genetic factor in ZF rats is associated with impaired vagal nerve-mediated control of insulin secretion. The genetic factor in WKY rats may diminish sensitivity to the vagal information of insulin release and contribute to insulin resistance. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of both genetic factors in a homo-allelic state is important to the development of DM in WF rats.
11112439	TSH induces insulin receptors that mediate insulin costimulation of growth in normal human thyroid cells.	The mitogenic/goitrogenic effects of thyrotropin (TSH) on human thyrocytes in vitro and in vivo depend on permissive comitogenic effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are mimicked in vitro by the low-affinity binding of high supraphysiological concentrations of insulin to IGF-I receptors. Contrary to general assumption, we show here that very low concentrations of insulin, acting through insulin receptors but not IGF-I receptors, can also support the stimulation of DNA synthesis by TSH in primary cultures of normal human thyrocytes. Moreover, TSH through cAMP increases the content of insulin receptors demonstrated by Western blotting and the cells' responsiveness to low insulin concentrations. These observations provide the first in vitro evidence in normal human thyroid cells of a functional interaction between TSH and insulin acting through its own receptor.
11113183	Altered extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling and glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle from p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 knockout mice.	The p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), a cytosolic substrate for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), is involved in transcriptional regulation, and one isoform (RSK2) has been implicated in the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin. To determine RSK2 function in vivo, mice lacking a functional rsk2 gene were generated and studied in response to insulin and exercise, two potent stimulators of the ERK cascade in skeletal muscle. RSK2 knockout (KO) mice weigh 10% less and are 14% shorter than wild-type (WT) mice. They also have impaired learning and coordination. Hindlimb skeletal muscles were obtained from mice 10, 15, or 30 min after insulin injection or immediately after strenuous treadmill exercise for 60 min. While insulin and exercise significantly increased ERK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from both WT and KO mice, the increases were twofold greater in the KO animals. This occurred despite 27% lower ERK2 protein expression in skeletal muscle of KO mice. KO mice had 18% less muscle glycogen in the fasted basal state, and insulin increased glycogen synthase activity more in KO than WT mice. The enhanced insulin-stimulated increases in ERK and glycogen synthase activities in KO mice were not associated with higher insulin receptor or with IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation or with IRS1 binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. However, insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt was significantly higher in the KO animals. c-fos mRNA was increased similarly in muscle from WT and KO mice in response to insulin (2. 5-fold) and exercise (15-fold). In conclusion, RSK2 likely plays a major role in feedback inhibition of the ERK pathway in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, RSK2 is not required for activation of muscle glycogen synthase by insulin but may indirectly modulate muscle glycogen synthase activity and/or glycogen content by other mechanisms, possibly through regulation of Akt. RSK2 knockout mice may be a good animal model for the study of Coffin-Lowry syndrome.
11113206	Essential role of insulin receptor substrate 1 in differentiation of brown adipocytes.	The most widely distributed members of the family of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are IRS-1 and IRS-2. These proteins participate in insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, as well as the actions of some cytokines, growth hormone, and prolactin. To more precisely define the specific role of IRS-1 in adipocyte biology, we established brown adipocyte cell lines from wild-type and IRS-1 knockout (KO) animals. Using differentiation protocols, both with and without insulin, preadipocyte cell lines derived from IRS-1 KO mice exhibited a marked decrease in differentiation and lipid accumulation (10 to 40%) compared to wild-type cells (90 to 100%). Furthermore, IRS-1 KO cells showed decreased expression of adipogenic marker proteins, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), fatty acid synthase, uncoupling protein-1, and glucose transporter 4. The differentiation deficit in the KO cells could be reversed almost completely by retrovirus-mediated reexpression of IRS-1, PPARgamma, or C/EBPalpha but not the thiazolidinedione troglitazone. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) assays performed at various stages of the differentiation process revealed a strong and transient activation in IRS-1, IRS-2, and phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase in the wild-type cells, whereas the IRS-1 KO cells showed impaired phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activation, all of which was associated with IRS-2. Akt phosphorylation was reduced in parallel with the total PI 3-kinase activity. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with LY294002 blocked differentiation of wild-type cells. Thus, IRS-1 appears to be an important mediator of brown adipocyte maturation. Furthermore, this signaling molecule appears to exert its unique role in the differentiation process via activation of PI 3-kinase and its downstream target, Akt, and is upstream of the effects of PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha.
11117677	Searching for the polycystic ovary syndrome genes.	PCOS is a common disorder of unknown etiology. Studies of first-degree relatives of women diagnosed with PCOS suggest familial clustering of the disease. A prospective study of first-degree female relatives of women with PCOS conducted by NCPIR found that 46% of ascertainable sisters of women with PCOS were hyperandrogenemic. NCPIR has conducted linkage and association studies using affected sibling-pair analysis and the transmission/disequilibrium test to explore candidate PCOS genes. These studies point a finger at a region 1 MB centromeric to the insulin receptor gene on chromosome 19.
11126235	Molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance and the role of the adipocyte.	Insulin resistance is a common feature of obesity and predisposes the affected individuals to a variety of diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemias, cardiovascular problems and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal insulin action and these other pathological states are not well understood. We have been focusing on cytokines, particularly TNFalpha and fatty acid binding proteins, as potential sites to study the molecular basis of these disorders. The role of TNFalpha in insulin resistance and other pathologies associated with obesity, have been examined in several experimental systems including obese mice with homozygous null mutations at the TNFalpha or TNF receptor loci. Analysis of these animals demonstrated that the genetic absence of TNF signaling in obesity: (i) significantly improves insulin receptor signaling capacity and consequently insulin sensitivity; (ii) prevents brown adipose tissue atrophy and beta3-adrenoreceptor deficiency and improves thermo-adaptive responses, (iii) decreases the elevated PAI-1 and TGFbeta production; and (iv) lowers hyperlipidemia and hyperleptinemia. Hence, abnormal TNFalpha action in adipocytes disturbs many aspects of metabolic homeostasis in obesity.
11139390	Insulin inhibits glucocorticoid-stimulated L-type 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene expression by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway.	The hepatic isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PF2K/Fru-2,6-BPase) is transcriptionally stimulated by glucocorticoids, whereas insulin blocks this stimulatory effect. Although this inhibitory effect has been extensively reported, nothing is known about the signalling pathway responsible. We have used well-characterized inhibitors for proteins involved in different signalling cascades to assess the involvement of these pathways on the transcriptional regulation of glucocorticoid-stimulated PF2K/Fru-2,6-BPase by insulin. Our results demonstrate that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p70/p85 ribosomal S6 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways are not involved in the inhibitory effect of insulin on glucocorticoid-stimulated PF2K/Fru-2,6-BPase. To evaluate the implication of the MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)-4-stress-activated protein kinase-c-Jun-N-terminal protein kinase ('JNK-SAPK') pathway we overexpressed the N-terminal JNK-binding domain of the JNK-interacting protein 1 ('JIP-1'), demonstrating that activation of JNK is necessary for the insulin inhibitory effect. Moreover, overexpression of MEK kinase 1 and JNK-haemagglutinin resulted in the inhibition of the glucocorticoid-stimulated PF2K/Fru-2,6-BPase. These results provide clear and specific evidence for the role of JNK in the insulin inhibition of glucocorticoid-stimulated PF2K/Fru-2,6-BPase gene expression. In addition, we performed experiments with a mutant of the glucocorticoid receptor in which the JNK phosphorylation target Ser-246 had been mutated to Ala. Our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor on Ser-246 is not responsible for the JNK repression of glucocorticoid-stimulated PF2K/Fru-2,6-BPase gene expression.
11145562	Transcriptional regulation of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor gene expression in prostate cancer cells.	A marked decrease in the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGF-IR) occurs in prostate epithelial cells during transformation from the benign to the metastatic state. One of the principal regulators of IGF-IR gene expression, the WT1 tumor suppressor, is expressed in prostate cancer and in prostate cancer cell lines. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the decrease in IGF-IR expression was transcriptionally regulated, and whether WT1 action may be involved in the repression of the IGF-IR gene in prostate cancer cells. The P69 cell line was derived by immortalization of human primary prostate epithelial cells with simian virus-40 T antigen and is rarely tumorigenic. The M12 line was derived from the P69 line by selection for tumor formation in nude mice and is tumorigeneic and metastatic. P69 cells express 20,000 IGF-IR/cell, whereas M12 cells express 3,500 IGF-IR/cell. These differences in receptor number are reflected in proportional differences in IGF-IR mRNA levels. To assess IGF-IR promoter activity in these cell lines, each was transiently transfected with luciferase reporter vectors containing the IGF-IR gene transcription start site and 476 bp of 5'-flanking sequence, 640 bp of 5'-untranslated region sequence, or both regions. The promoter activity of the full-length construct was 50% lower (P < 0.01) in M12 cells compared with P69 cells, the activity of the 5'-flanking region construct was 53% lower (P < 0.0001), and that of the 5'-untranslated region construct was 36% lower (P = 0.01). P69 clones stably transfected with a WT1 expression vector exhibited decreased expression of the endogenous IGF-IR gene and decreased promoter activity in transient transfection assays with IGF-IR promoter constructs containing multiple WT1 binding sites. The observed reduction in endogenous IGF-IR expression was sufficient to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation. These data suggest that most of the decreased expression of the IGF-IR seen in malignant prostate epithelium is the result of transcriptional repression of the IGF-IR gene, and that this repression may be due in part to the increased expression of the WT1 tumor suppressor in metastatic prostate cancer.
11145575	Regulated expression of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel subunits in pancreatic beta-cells.	The regulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells is linked to the expression and function of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP)), which is composed of a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) and an inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir6.2). Previous animal and human genetic studies have demonstrated that disruption or defective expression of K(ATP) subunit genes has a profound impact on the regulation of insulin secretion. Little is known about how SUR1 and Kir6.2 gene expression is regulated. Here we show that high glucose concentrations lead to a marked decrease (approximately 70%) in Kir6.2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in isolated rat pancreatic islets as well as in the INS-1 beta-cell line. This effect is reversible, because exposure to low glucose reinduces Kir6.2 transcript levels. The cognate K(ATP) channel subunit SUR1 showed similar down-regulation at high glucose concentration. The K(ATP) channel activity of INS-1 cells cultivated at high glucose was reduced by 33-51%. In contrast, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) induced Kir6.2 mRNA steady state levels and was able to prevent glucose-dependent inhibition of Kir6.2 mRNA and K(ATP) channel activity. To provide further insight into the mechanisms by which glucose and GLP-1 regulate beta-cell K(ATP) channel genes, we have cloned and initiated the characterization of the Kir6.2 gene transcriptional regulatory regions contained within the entire 4.5 kb flanked by the SUR1 and Kir6.2 genes. Transient transfection experiments with five deletion constructs in a pancreatic beta-cell line (INS-1) showed that the proximal 988 bp of the Kir6.2 promoter sequence contributes only 25-30% to the total basal promoter activity. The minimal promoter region -67/+140, also encompassing parts of the 5'-untranslated region, confers sensitivity to GLP-1, which stimulates transcriptional activity of the Kir6.2 minigene by about 2-fold. We propose that glucose- and GLP-1-dependent regulation of K(ATP) subunit genes may be important in the adaptation of beta-cells to changes in secretory demands in physiological and diseased states.
11146233	Expression levels of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins and insulin receptor isoforms in hepatoblastomas.	Hepatoblastoma, a rare pediatric liver tumour, is a poorly understood disease. While expression studies for some members of the Insulin-like growth factor axis have been studied in hepatoblastoma, a systematic analysis of the IGF-axis has not been carried out. We have examined a series of hepatoblastomas with matched normal liver tissue for gene expression differences with emphasis on members of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins. The expression profiles obtained reveal that the expression of these genes are altered in these tumors. The results indicate that the IGF-axis is seriously disturbed in the tumors.
11149601	Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase selectively inhibits cell proliferation in human breast cancer cells displaying enhanced insulin-like growth factor I-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.	Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase mediates cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival by regulating signaling pathways activated by receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs), including the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR). We analyzed the upstream signaling components of the MAP kinase pathway, including RPTKs, in human breast cancer cell lines and found that some of those components were overexpressed. Importantly, signaling molecules such as IGF-IR, insulin receptor, and insulin receptor substrate 1, leading to the MAP kinase pathway, were found to be concomitantly overexpressed within certain tumor lines, i.e., MCF-7 and T-47D. When compared with the nonmalignant and other breast tumor lines examined, MCF-7 and T-47D cells displayed a more rapid, robust, and sustained MAP kinase activation in response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulation. By contrast, IGF-I treatment led to a sustained down-regulation of MAP kinase in those lines overexpressing ErbB2-related RPTKs. Interestingly, blocking the MAP kinase pathway with PD098059 had the greatest antiproliferative effect on MCF-7 and T-47D among the normal and tumor lines tested. Furthermore, addition of an IGF-IR blocking antibody to growth medium attenuated the ability of PD098059 to suppress the growth of MCF-7 and T-47D cells. Thus, our study suggests that concomitant overexpression of multiple signaling components of the IGF-IR pathway leads to the amplification of IGF-I-mediated MAP kinase signaling and resultant sensitization to PD098059. The enhanced sensitivity to PD098059 implies an increased requirement for the MAP kinase pathway in those breast cancer cells, making this pathway a potential target in the treatment of selected breast malignancies.
11160325	Fes mediates the IL-4 activation of insulin receptor substrate-2 and cellular proliferation.	Although Jak kinases are essential for initiating cytokine signaling, the role of other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in this process remains unclear. We have examined the role of Fes in IL-4 signaling. Examination of Jak1-deficient cell lines demonstrates that Jak1 is required for the activation of Fes by IL-4. Experiments studying signaling molecules activated by IL-4 receptor suggest that IL-4 signaling can be subdivided into Fes-dependent and Fes-independent pathways. Overexpression of kinase-inactive Fes blocks the IL-4 activation of insulin receptor substrate-2, but not STAT6. Fes appears to be a downstream kinase from Jak1/Jak3 in this process. Further examination of downstream signaling demonstrates that kinase-inactive Fes inhibits the recruitment of phosphoinositide 3-kinase to the activated IL-4 receptor complex and decreases the activation of p70(S6k) kinase in response to IL-4. This inhibition correlates with a decrease in IL-4-induced proliferation. In contrast, mutant Fes does not inhibit the activation of Akt by IL-4. These data demonstrate that signaling pathways activated by IL-4 require different tyrosine kinases. This differential requirement predicts that specific kinase inhibitors may permit the disruption of specific IL-4-induced functions.
11162472	Effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids and clofibrate on chicken stearoyl-coA desaturase 1 gene expression.	In chicken, adiposity is influenced by hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) 1. This gene is up-regulated by low-fat high-carbohydrate diet and down-regulated by addition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In this study, we present evidence for an inhibition of chicken SCD1 expression by PUFA using reporter gene constructs in transient transfection assays. This inhibition does not involve the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway, in contrast with what has been observed in rodents. We were able to localise a PUFA as well as an insulin response element within the -372/+125 bp region of the promoter. Sequence analyses of this region allowed identification of several cis-regulatory elements: A sterol regulatory element (SRE) and a juxtaposed NF-Y element which have been shown to be involved in the regulation of mouse SCD genes by PUFA. In addition, we identified an overlapping Sp1/USF motif, which was described to play a role in insulin/glucose and PUFA regulation of fatty synthase, ATP-citrate-lyase, and leptin genes. These data provide the first characterisation of the chicken SCD1 promoter and putative cis-sequences involved in the regulation of this gene by PUFA and insulin.
11163495	Loss of heterozygosity at the mannose 6-phosphate insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R) locus predisposes patients to radiation-induced lung injury.	PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R) gene locus and the development of radiation-induced lung injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five lung cancer patients with both stored plasma for Transforming Growth Factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) analysis and sufficient quantities of archival pathology tissue to screen for LOH were studied. All patients had been treated with thoracic radiotherapy for their malignancy and had radiographically detectable tumor present before beginning radiotherapy. Tumor and normal cells were microdissected from archival lung cancer pathology specimens. Two polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region of the M6P/IGF2R were used to screen for LOH. Plasma TGFbeta1 levels were measured using acid-ethanol extraction and an ELISA. TGFbeta1 and M6P/IGF2R protein expression was estimated by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was scored according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria without knowledge of the results of TGFbeta or LOH analyses. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients, 10 were homozygous for this polymorphism (noninformative) and were excluded. Of the 25 informative patients, 13 had LOH. Twelve of 13 patients with LOH had increased pretreatment plasma TGFbeta1 levels, vs. 3/12 patients without LOH (p < 0.01). A decrease or loss of M6P/IGF2R protein in the malignant cell accompanied by increased latent TGFbeta1 protein in extracellular matrix and tumor stroma was found in tumors with LOH, suggesting that this mutation resulted in loss of function of the receptor. Seven of 13 (54%) LOH patients developed symptomatic radiation-induced lung injury vs. 1/12 (8%) of patients without LOH (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Loss of the M6P/IGF2R gene strongly correlates with the development of radiation pneumonitis after thoracic radiotherapy (RT). Furthermore, patients with LOH (in the setting of measurable tumor) are much more likely to have elevated plasma TGFbeta, suggesting an inability to normally process this cytokine. Thus, loss of the M6P/IGF2R gene may predispose patients to the development of radiation-induced lung injury.
11176456	Distinct microsatellite alterations in upper urinary tract tumors and subsequent bladder tumors.	PURPOSE: Although synchronous and/or metachronous tumor development is common in urothelial cancer, genetic and biological differences in upper urinary tract and bladder tumors are unclear. We compared the genetic alteration pattern in multifocal disease in patients with upper urinary tract and subsequent bladder tumors, and those with recurrent bladder tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 21 microsatellite markers on the 8 chromosomal arms 2q, 4p, 4q, 8p, 9p, 9q, 11p and 17p we analyzed 34 tumors from 15 patients with upper urinary tract and subsequent bladder disease, and 70 tumors from 22 with recurrent bladder disease. RESULTS: Judging from the patterns of genetic alterations multifocal tumors were considered to have derived from an identical progenitor cell in 7 of 13 evaluable patients (54%) with upper urinary tract and subsequent bladder tumors, and 16 of 19 (84%) who were evaluable with recurrent bladder tumor. These data confirm the view that seeding or intraepithelial spread is a major mechanism for the multifocal development of urothelial cancer in general. However, a discordant microsatellite alteration pattern in multifocal tumors was observed in 6 of 7 patients (86%) with upper urinary tract and subsequent bladder lesions but in 2 of 16 (13%) with recurrent bladder cancer (p <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that upper urinary tract neoplasms may be genetically more unstable than bladder neoplasms. The implantation of tumor cells from upper urinary tract to bladder may involve additional and diverse genetic alterations. Furthermore, a considerable number of multifocal upper urinary tract and subsequent bladder lesions may arise independently via field cancerization mechanism. Our study indicates that the factors contributing to multifocal development are different in the 2 groups.
11193160	Inhibition of the neuronal insulin receptor. An in vivo model for sporadic Alzheimer disease?	It has been hypothesized that a central even in the early pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer disease (SAD) is the dysfunction of the neuronal insulin receptor signal transduction. To prove this, this receptor was inhibited by a triplicate icv application of STZ. Insulin binding sites were upregulated as in SAD. With respect to glucose transport proteins, detailed investigations are necessary.
11202567	The Cre-loxP system: a versatile tool for targeting genes in a cell- and stage-specific manner.	Gene-targeted mice, derived from embryonic stem cells, are useful tools to study gene function during development. However, if the inactivation of the target gene results in embryonic lethality, the postdevelopmental function of the gene cannot be further studied. The Cre recombinase-loxP (Cre-loxP) system was developed to overcome this limitation as well as to confine the inactivation of the target gene in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. This system allows for the inactivation of the target gene in a single cell type, thereby allowing the analysis of physiological and pathophysiological consequences of the genetic alteration in mature animals. A unique property of the insulin gene to be expressed only in pancreatic beta cells has allowed using the beta-cell-specific rat insulin promoter (RIP) for Cre recombinase expression to inactivate genes in beta cells. The RIP has been used to inactivate genes in beta cells and analysis of these genetically altered mice has provided important information regarding the role of potential transcription factors and the receptors in vivo, for regulation of insulin gene transcription and in the development of beta cells. The Cre-loxP system is at a relatively early stage of development, and the ability of this technique to virtually target any gene in any tissue at any stage of development makes the study of gene function in a single cell type in vivo an attainable goal. It is anticipated that the continued experience with this system will provide an important tool to determine the role of the transcription factors involved in insulin gene regulation and islet cell differentiation and ultimately provide the basis for novel therapy to treat diabetes.
11206220	Effect of breast surgery on serum levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF binding protein-3) in women with benign and malignant breast lesions.	BACKGROUND: There is evidence that insulin-like growth factors play a role in the development of breast cancer. Antiestrogens reduce circulating levels of IGF-I, but the influence of other breast cancer treatments, including surgery, is unknown and is investigated in this study. METHODS: Circulating serum concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were measured before and after breast surgery in 31 patients with breast cancer and 12 controls with benign breast lesions. Serum albumin was measured as a marker of the nonspecific metabolic effect of surgery. RESULTS: Serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3, and albumin fell 24 hours after surgery for breast cancer but largely normalized again over the next 7 days. The fall in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 was not significant when the change in serum albumin was used as a covariate, suggesting a nonspecific effect of surgery. However, the reduction in IGF-II remained significant when adjusted for albumin and was greater after lumpectomy of malignant tumors (-8 +/- 2%) compared with benign disease (2 +/- 2%, P = .001). The fall in IGF-II was significantly related to the size of the removed tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer may directly influence the serum concentration of IGF-II, possibly by direct tumor production.
11208920	Inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and IRS-2 signaling by ethanol in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.	The effect of ethanol on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I)-mediated signal transduction and functional activation in neuronal cells was examined. In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, ethanol inhibited tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor. This corresponded to the inhibition of IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MAPK) by ethanol. Insulin-related substrate-2 (IRS-2) and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation were reduced in the presence of ethanol, which corresponded to the prevention of lamellipodia formation (30 min). By contrast, ethanol had no effect on Shc phosphorylation when measured up to 1 h, and did not affect the association of Grb-2 with Shc. Neurite formation at 24 h was similarly unaffected by ethanol. The data indicate that the IGF-I receptor is a target for ethanol in SH-SY5Y cells However, there is diversity in the sensitivity of signaling elements within the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase signaling cascades to ethanol, which can be related to the inhibition of specific functional events in neuronal activation.
11211609	PS6K amplification characterizes a small subset of anaplastic meningiomas.	PS6K, a putative oncogene mapped to chromosome 17q23, encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which phosphorylates ribosomal subunit 6 and is part of the insulin receptor signal transduction pathway involved in the regulation of messenger RNA translation, protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, and cell size. Comparative genomic hybridization studies have detected 17q23 amplifications in a subset of meningiomas, particularly those with aggressive histologic features. PS6K amplifications have been reported in breast cancer, another hormonally driven neoplasm. We assessed PS6K dosage in 94 archival paraffin-embedded meningiomas using dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. We found high-level PS6K amplifications in 3 of 22 anaplastic grade III meningiomas. Amplification was confirmed by differential polymerase chain reaction in 1 of these cases. In contrast, no amplifications were identified in 37 benign (grade I) and 35 atypical (grade II) meningiomas. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of gene amplification in primary human meningiomas. Given its exclusive association with anaplastic meningiomas, PS6K amplification likely occurs during the malignant progression of a small subset of anaplastic tumors. Further studies are needed to map the 17q23 amplicon to determine whether additional genes in this region are amplified in high-grade meningiomas.
11212254	AKT activation up-regulates insulin-like growth factor I receptor expression and promotes invasiveness of human pancreatic cancer cells.	Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is frequently overexpressed in several types of human malignancy and is associated with invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Recently, IGF-IR expression was reported to be up-regulated in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 when cells were stably transfected with active Src. The downstream targets of Src that lead to the up-regulation of IGF-IR expression were previously unknown. We demonstrate here that AKT regulates IGF-IR expression in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells. Cells transfected with active Src exhibited significantly more IGF-IR protein compared with vector-transfected cells. Overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active AKT (i.e., AKT1 or AKT2) also resulted in elevated IGF-IR expression. IGF-IR protein levels were higher in cells transfected with constitutively active AKT than in cells transfected with active Src. In vitro kinase assays showed that AKT kinases are activated by active Src and inhibited by dominant negative Src or the tumor suppressor PTEN. Furthermore, AKT-induced IGF-IR expression was down-regulated by dominant-negative Src or PTEN. In addition, cells transfected with activated AKT in the presence of IGF-I were shown to have enhanced invasiveness compared with control cells. These data provide evidence for a link between AKT signaling and the regulation of IGF-IR expression and demonstrate that active AKT promotes the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells through the up-regulation of IGF-IR expression.
11221151	Genetic causes of familial hypercholesterolaemia in a Malaysian population.	A total of 86 unrelated Malaysian patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) were studied for mutations in their low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) gene. Amongst them, 23 had a LDL-R gene mutation, while none having an Apolipoprotein B-3500 (Apo B-3500) mutation. Patients with the LDL-R gene defect appeared to have a higher level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), an increased incidence of xanthomas and coronary heart disease (CHD), but no relationships were found between the type of LDL-R gene mutations and their lipid levels or clinical signs of CHD. In contrast to Western data, our findings seemed to indicate a predominance of mutations in the ligand binding domain and an absence of Apo B-3500 gene mutation. The latter finding may offer a genetic basis as to why Asian patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia have lower LDL-C levels and less premature CHD than their Western counterparts.
11222161	[Identification and characterization of the first Spanish familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein B homozygote].	BACKGROUND: Familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein B 100 (FDB) is an autosomal inherited disease due to mutations on apo B 100, clinically indistinguishable from familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). We described the first Spanish homozygote for FDB. METHODS: We have screened R3500Q mutation of apo B gene (PCR-SSCP analysis) in a large family with FDB and have identified the first Spanish homozygote for FDB. RESULTS: The homozygote is a 58 year-old man with coronary heart disease, no presence of xanthomata and with total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol plasma levels of 415 and 352 mg/dl. The response to statins and resins was up to 42% for total cholesterol and 51% for LDLc plasma values. The LDL receptor activity was normal in the FDB homozygote. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified and characterised the first Spanish homozygote for FDB (R3500Q mutation). Our data indicate a moderate lipoprotein phenotype in FDB homozygote, different as expected comparing to homozygous FH.
11223541	Molecular significance of excess body weight in postmenopausal breast cancer patients, in relation to expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor and insulin-like growth factor II genes.	A number of epidemiological and clinical studies have revealed that excess body weight increases the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and also adversely affects subsequent malignant progression. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations, we examined mRNA expression of various genes in normal (non-cancerous) mammary gland and cancer tissue of Japanese patients with primary breast cancer, in association with their body mass index (BMI). On the basis of analysis of 106 breast cancer patients, we found that mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) in the normal mammary gland showed a significant and positive association with increased BMI among postmenopausal patients. Furthermore, the positive association of increased BMI with IGF-IR mRNA expression was also found in postmenopausal breast cancer tissue, while this association was not observed among premenopausal patients. In addition, increased mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and bcl-2 was observed in association with increased mRNA levels of IGF-IR among the patients regardless of menopausal status. These findings suggest that the molecular consequence of the increased BMI is the increased expression of IGF-II and IGF-IR, resulting in development of postmenopausal breast cancer and its progression mediated through modulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.
11225259	[Growth hormone receptor antagonists: potential indications].	Pegvisomant is a mutated human growth hormone molecule, which binds to the growth hormone receptor. This binding, however, does not lead to signal transduction. Therefore, in high concentrations pegvisomant acts as a growth hormone receptor antagonist. In a short term study (3 months) pegvisomant was shown to be an effective treatment for acromegaly. On theoretical grounds decreasing the biological effects of growth hormone in patients with diabetes mellitus could have a favourable impact on the severity of the secondary complications associated with this disease. Animal models for diabetic retino- and nephropathy are in accordance with this concept. Human data are lacking but clinical studies investigating the effect of pegvisomant in diabetes mellitus are in preparation. Growth hormone, either directly or via its downstream effector insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has been implicated as an important factor in the growth of malignant tumours. Animal studies in which human colon and breast cancer models were used showed that pegvisomant can powerfully decrease tumour growth. Studies in cancer patients have not yet started.
11229437	Interactions among the glucocorticoid receptor, lipoprotein lipase, and adrenergic receptor genes and plasma insulin and lipid levels in the Quebec Family Study.	The aim of the study was to investigate the possible interactions among the glucocorticoid receptor (GRL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and adrenergic receptor (ADR) genes on plasma insulin and lipid levels. The study was cross-sectional and based on 742 individuals from phase 2 of the Quebec Family Study (QFS) cohort. Gene markers were identified by Southern blot analysis or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Plasma glucose and insulin in the fasted state and during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were determined and insulin and glucose areas were computed. Triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol concentrations in plasma and lipoprotein fractions were determined enzymatically. The results show that GRL and LPL variants had independent effects on plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and two beta2-ADR variants were related to total cholesterol concentrations. The alpha2-ADR gene Dral polymorphism was the only variant that had an independent effect on the plasma insulin area. Gene-gene interaction effects were found between GRL and alpha2-ADR genes for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ([LDL-C] P = .013) and between GRL and LPL genes for HDL-C (P = .045). Higher-order interaction effects involving GRL, LPL, and ADR markers were observed for the plasma insulin area (P = .001 to .025) but not the glucose area. After correction for multiple tests, the findings remained essentially unchanged for the insulin area but became nonsignificant for the lipid phenotypes. In conclusion, multiple interactions among GRL, LPL, and ADR gene markers contribute to insulin metabolism and perhaps to lipid levels, while no significant effect is found for each gene separately. The LPL locus appears to determine the pattern of interactions with ADR and GRL loci. These results suggest that gene-gene interaction effects could play a role in the etiology of risk factors for common chronic diseases.
11230180	PTEN inhibits insulin-stimulated MEK/MAPK activation and cell growth by blocking IRS-1 phosphorylation and IRS-1/Grb-2/Sos complex formation in a breast cancer model.	The tumour suppressor gene PTEN encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that recognizes protein substrates and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate. PTEN seems to play multiple roles in tumour suppression and the blockade of phosphoinositide-3-kinase signalling is important for its growth suppressive effects, although precise mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we show that PTEN plays a unique role in the insulin-signalling pathway in a breast cancer model. Ectopic expression of wild-type PTEN in MCF-7 epithelial breast cancer cells resulted in universal inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in response to stimulation by diverse growth factors and selective inhibition of MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation stimulated by insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The latter was accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and the association of IRS-1 with Grb2/Sos, without affecting the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and Shc, nor Shc/Grb2 complex formation. The MEK inhibitor, PD980059, but not the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the effect of PTEN on insulin-stimulated cell growth. Without addition of insulin, wortmannin reduced PTEN-mediated growth suppression, whereas PD980059 had little effect, suggesting that PTEN suppresses insulin-stimulated cell growth by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, PD980059 treatment led to the downregulation of cyclin D1 and the suppression of cell cycle progression. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks MAPK phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-1/Grb2/Sos complex formation, which leads to downregulation of cyclin D1, inhibition of cell cycle progression and suppression of cell growth.
11237210	Ras activation of the Raf kinase: tyrosine kinase recruitment of the MAP kinase cascade.	A continuing focus of our work has been an effort to understand the signal transduction pathways through which insulin achieves its cellular actions. In the mid-1970s, we and others observed that insulin promoted an increase in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of a subset of cellular proteins. This finding was unanticipated, inasmuch as nearly all of the actions of insulin then known appeared to result from protein dephosphorylation. In fact, nearly 15 years elapsed before any physiologic response to insulin attributable to stimulated (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation was established. Nevertheless, based on the hypothesis that insulin-stimulated Ser/Thr phosphorylation reflected the activation of protein (Ser/Thr) kinases downstream of the insulin receptor, we sought to detect and purify these putative, insulin-responsive protein (Ser/Thr) kinases. Our effort was based on the presumption that an understanding of the mechanism for their activation would provide an entry into the biochemical reactions through which the insulin receptor activated its downstream effectors. To a degree that, in retrospect, is surprising, this goal was accomplished, much in the way originally envisioned. It is now well known that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) recruit a large network of protein (Ser/Thr) kinases to execute their cellular programs. The first of these insulin-activated protein kinase networks to be fully elucidated was the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. This pathway is a central effector of cellular differentiation in development; moreover, its inappropriate and continuous activation provides a potent promitogenic force and is a very common occurrence in human cancers. Conversely, this pathway contributes minimally, if at all, to insulin's program of metabolic regulation. Nevertheless, the importance of the Ras-MAPK pathway in metazoan biology and human malignancies has impelled us to an ongoing analysis of the functions and regulation of Ras and Raf. This chapter will summarize briefly the way in which work from this and other laboratories on insulin signaling led to the discovery of the mammalian MAP kinase cascade and, in turn, to the identification of unique role of the Raf kinases in RTK activation of this protein (Ser/Thr) kinase cascade. We will then review in more detail current understanding of the biochemical mechanism through which the Ras proto-oncogene, in collaboration with the 14-3-3 protein and other protein kinases, initiates activation of the Raf kinase.
11238294	Compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 produce exaggerated hypercholesterolemia.	BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) represent ligand-receptor disorders that are complementary. Individuals with both FH and FDB are unusual. We report a family with both disorders and the impact of the mutations on the phenotypes of the family members. METHODS: We used single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for genetic analysis of all 18 exons and the promoter region of the LDL receptor and DGGE for genetic analysis of the apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) gene. The functional significance of the apo B-100 mutation was studied using a U937 cell proliferation assay. Fasting serum lipid profiles were determined for the index case and seven first-degree relatives. RESULTS: One of the patient's sisters had a missense mutation (Asp(407)-->Lys) in exon 9 of the LDL receptor and a serum LDL-cholesterol concentration of 4.07 mmol/L. Four other first-degree relatives had hyperlipidemia but no LDL-receptor mutation. However, these subjects had a mutation of the apo B-100 gene (Arg(3500)-->Trp). The cell proliferation rate of U937 cells fed with LDL from other subjects with the same mutation was fourfold less than that of controls. The index case had both FH- and FDB-related mutations. Her serum LDL-cholesterol (9.47 mmol/L) was higher than all other relatives tested. CONCLUSIONS: Existence of both FH and FDB should be considered in families with LDL-receptor mutations in some but not all individuals with hypercholesterolemia or when some individuals in families with FH exhibit exaggerated hypercholesterolemia.
11238471	Clinical review 125: The insulin receptor and its cellular targets.	The pleiotropic actions of insulin are mediated by a single receptor tyrosine kinase. Structure/function relationships of the insulin receptor have been conclusively established, and the early steps of insulin signaling are known in some detail. A generally accepted paradigm is that insulin receptors, acting through insulin receptor substrates, stimulate the lipid kinase activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The rapid rise in Tris-phosphorylated inositol (PIP(3)) that ensues triggers a cascade of PIP(3)-dependent serine/threonine kinases. Among the latter, Akt (a product of the akt protooncogene) and atypical protein kinase C isoforms are thought to be involved in insulin regulation of glucose transport and oxidation; glycogen, lipid, and protein synthesis; and modulation of gene expression. The presence of multiple insulin-regulated, PIP(3)-dependent kinases is consistent with the possibility that different pathways are required to regulate different biological actions of insulin. Additional work remains to be performed to understand the distal components of insulin signaling. Moreover, there exists substantial evidence for insulin receptor substrate- and/or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent pathways of insulin action. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to provide clues to the pathogenesis and treatment of the insulin resistant state that is characteristic of type 2 diabetes.
11238520	Novel promoter polymorphism in insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3: correlation with serum levels and interaction with known regulators.	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a major determinant of circulating levels of the IGFs and is clinically useful for the evaluation of GH deficiency and for predicting the response to GH treatment. Recent studies provide evidence that the circulating level of IGFBP-3 is inversely related to the risk of several common cancers, and that antiproliferative agents such as antiestrogens and retinoids act in part by up-regulating IGFBP-3 gene (IGFBP3) expression. Although approximately 50% of the substantial interindividual variability in circulating IGFBP-3 levels is known to have a genetic basis, the specific loci involved are unknown. Direct sequencing of genomic DNA specimens from a multiethnic population identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of IGFBP3. For the most common single nucleotide polymorphism (nucleotide -202) found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, genotype was highly correlated to circulating level of IGFBP-3 in 478 men from the Physicians' Health Study. In vitro, we documented significantly higher promoter activity of the A allele at the -202 locus compared with the C allele, consistent with the relationship observed between genotype and circulating IGFBP-3 (AA > AC > CC). A positive correlation was observed between circulating retinol levels and circulating IGFBP-3 levels; subset analysis by genotype showed that this relationship was only present among individuals carrying an A allele at -202 (AA > AC > CC). Tall individuals or individuals with a body mass index of 27 or greater had levels of circulating IGFBP-3 that were significantly higher when they possessed at least one A allele (AA > AC > CC). The IGFBP3 promoter region deserves investigation as a locus where polymorphic variation occurs frequently and may influence GH responsiveness, somatic growth, and possibly cancer risk.
11238530	Leptin is associated with increased prostate cancer risk: a nested case-referent study.	A Western lifestyle has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. However, no clear association between obesity and prostate cancer has been shown. Leptin may stimulate prostate growth and angiogenesis, and receptors for leptin are present in the prostate. Leptin may, thus, be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. One hundred forty-nine men with prostate cancer were identified (together with 298 matched referents) who, before diagnosis, had participated in population-based health surveys in Northern Sweden. Blood pressure, body mass index, and use of tobacco were recorded. Leptin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-I-binding proteins 1-3, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were analyzed in stored samples. Their influences on prostate cancer were estimated by conditional logistic regression analysis. Prostate cancer specimens were investigated for immunoreactivity for the leptin receptor. Relative risk (95% confidence intervals) estimates of prostate cancer over the quintiles of leptin were 1.0, 2.1 (1.1-4.1), 2.6 (1.4-4.8), 1.4 (0.7-2.7), and 1.6 (0.8-3.2). Adjustments for metabolic variables, testosterone, and IGF-I and its binding proteins did not attenuate this increased risk. Immunoreactivity for the leptin receptor was detected in normal, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions and malignant prostatic epithelium. Moderately elevated plasma leptin concentrations are associated with later development of prostate cancer. This may be due to direct effects of leptin on prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, or to indirect actions through other mechanisms. A critical fat mass related to an interior milieu favorable for prostate cancer development seems to exist, because intermediate but not high leptin levels are related to prostate cancer risk.
11239554	Altered autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the ovary of a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) in the ovary of a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was reduced compared to normal. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. PATIENT(S): One woman with PCOS and one healthy control, both of whom underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. INTERVENTION(S): Plasma membrane fraction of ovarian tissue was isolated, and the IR was purified and concentrated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Western blots of the IR, which had been incubated with and without insulin, were prepared. Colorimetric and chemiluminescent methods were used to detect the presence of the IR beta-subunit and IR tyrosine autophosphorylation, respectively. RESULT(S): The presence of the beta-subunit of the IR was identified in both ovarian samples. The degree of insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine autophosphorylation, reflected by the mean (+/-SD) relative optical density of the 95 kd band, was 4.3-fold higher in the normal ovary compared to the PCOS ovary (0.56 +/- 0.18 optical density vs. 0.13 +/- 0.10 optical density, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IR may be decreased in the ovaries of women with PCOS, similar to the findings in other tissues. The mechanisms through which insulin acts to produce an excess in ovarian androgen production in the face of a decrease in ovarian IR autophosphorylation remain to be determined.
11242979	[Screening for mutations in apolipoprotein B genes in a group of patients with hyperlipoproteinemia].	BACKGROUND: Familial defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 (FDB) is a common inherited metabolic disorder. Reduced binding of the apo B-100, the major protein of LDL particles, to LDL receptor results in marked hypercholesterolemia. FDB is caused particularly by an arginine to glutamine substitution at the codon for amino acid 3500 of the apo B-100. The aim of this study was to determine mutations potentially responsible for hypercholesterolemia in the apo B gene and to estimate their frequency in the group of Czech hyperlipidemic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The groups of 169 unrelated patients with primary isolated hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol/l, triglycerides < or = 2.3 mmol/l) and 58 unrelated patients with combined hyperlipoproteinemia (total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol/l, triglycerides > 2.3 mmol/l) were screened for mutations in codon 3500 region of the apolipoprotein B gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Mutation R3500Q was detected in 20 patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia (11.8%) and in 2 patients with combined hyperlipoproteinemia (3.4%). No other mutations were found. CONCLUSION: The frequency of FDB in our group of patients with primary isolated hypercholesterolemia is high when compared with data published in other countries. We suggest that all patients with primary isolated hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol/l) in the Czech Republic should be analysed for the presence of mutation R3500Q in the apo B gene.
11245436	Up-regulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by insulin-like growth factor-I depends upon phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.	Elevated levels of urokinase plasminogen activator-1 (uPA) and the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) are associated with breast cancer recurrence and decreased survival. It is possible that activation of IGF-IR and elevations in uPA are mechanistically linked. Our laboratory recently showed that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induces uPA protein and mRNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. We also found that IGF-IR and uPA were commonly overexpressed in primary breast cancers. In this study, we investigated the signal transduction pathway through which IGF-I regulates uPA. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and p70 kinase were inhibited with LY294002, PD98059, and rapamycin, respectively. Induction of uPA protein by IGF-I was partially inhibited by LY294002 (60% inhibition) or PD98059 (30% inhibition) but not by rapamycin. The production of uPA protein induced by IGF-I was blocked up to 90% by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Furthermore, herbimycin A suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT and Erk1/2. Next, we tested the impact of the signal transduction inhibitors on uPA gene expression. Both LY294002 and PD98059 were required to completely inhibit uPA mRNA expression, whereas each drug alone resulted in approximately 50% reduction in uPA expression. Next, using a minimal uPA-luciferase promoter construct containing the binding sites for the AP-1 and Ets transcription factors, we observed that IGF-I stimulated the uPA promoter via these sites. Furthermore, both Ly294002 and PD98059 were necessary to block IGF-I-stimulated uPA-Luc activity. In summary, we conclude that IGF-I requires both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-dependent pathways to optimally induce uPA expression. These findings suggest that the development of drugs targeting these pathways may benefit breast cancer patients at a high risk of recurrence, such as those who have primary tumors overexpressing IGF-IR and uPA.
11245597	Differential effects of flavonoids on 3T3-L1 adipogenesis and lipolysis.	Flavonoids, polyphenolic compounds that exist widely in plants, inhibit cell proliferation and increase cell differentiation in many cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Because terminal differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes depends on proliferation of both pre- and postconfluent preadipocytes, we predicted that flavonoids would inhibit adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. The flavonoids genistein and naringenin inhibited proliferation of preconfluent preadipocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When added to 2-day postconfluent preadipocytes at the induction of differentiation, genistein inhibited mitotic clonal expansion, triglyceride accumulation, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma expression, but naringenin had no effect. The antiadipogenic effect of genistein was not due to inhibition of insulin receptor subtrate-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. When added 3 days after induction of differentiation, neither flavonoid inhibited differentiation. In fully differentiated adipocytes, genistein increased basal and epinephrine-induced lipolysis, but naringenin had no significant effects. These data demonstrate that genistein and naringenin, despite structural similarity, have differential effects on adipogenesis and adipocyte lipid metabolism.
11249736	Technology evaluation: SAGE, Genzyme molecular oncology.	Genzyme Molecular Oncology (GMO) is using its SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) combinatorial chemistry technology to screen compound libraries. SAGE is a high-throughput, high-efficiency method to simultaneously detect and measure the expression levels of genes expressed in a cell at a given time, including rare genes. SAGE can be used in a wide variety of applications to identify disease-related genes, to analyze the effect of drugs on tissues and to provide insights into disease pathways. It works by isolating short fragments of genetic information from the expressed genes that are present in the cell being studied. These short sequences, called SAGE tags, are linked together for efficient sequencing. The sequence data are then analyzed to identify each gene expressed in the cell and the levels at which each gene is expressed. This information forms a library that can be used to analyze the differences in gene expression between cells [293437]. By December 1999, GMO had identified a set of 40 genes from 3.5 million transcripts that were expressed at elevated levels in all cancer tissue but not seen in normal tissue. The company hope these may provide diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets. The studies also provided data furthering the understanding of the way cells use their genome [349968]. GMO has signed a collaborative agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to search for new drug candidates in the field of cancer chemotherapy. The collaboration combines GMO's SAGE technology with the NCI's extensive array of 60 cell-based cancer screens. Under the agreement, the NCI will evaluate Genzyme's library consisting of one million compounds against selected cancer screens to identify compounds with anticancer properties [255082]. Xenometrix granted a license agreement for gene expression profiling to GMO in February 1999, giving company access to claims covered in issued US and European patents. The license is non-exclusive and covers the collection of gene expression profiles utilizing all methods including high-density microarrays [315329]. Ontogeny (now Curis Inc) and GMO have entered into a collaboration to study genes for the potential discovery of therapeutic products. GMO will use its SAGE technology to produce libraries of RNA supplied by Ontogeny. The libraries will be put through Ontogeny's screening program [279417]. Under an agreement made in August 1998, Bayer will use SAGE technology to identify genes and thus potential therapeutics [317452]. GMO and Hexagen signed an agreement in March 1998 on the use of SAGE technology in Hexagen's disease gene discovery programs. The first phase of the collaboration will focus on the use of SAGE in studies within Hexagen's type II diabetes gene discovery program. Hexagen has designed these studies to discover susceptibility genes for diabetes and to provide gene expression information for genes associated with type II diabetes [280012]. GMO signed a five-year agreement with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHU) in July 1997 for research leading to the identification of cancer-related genes. Under the terms of the agreement, JHU researchers will use the SAGE technology to identify and analyze gene expression in cancer. The power of SAGE in finding rare genes was confirmed in a study of gastrointestinal cancer by JHU researchers published in the May 27, 1997 issue of Science. The study showed that of almost 50,000 genes expressed in normal gastrointestinal cells and gastrointestinal tumor cells, 86% of the genes were present at five or fewer copies per cell. Only 51% of those low-abundancy genes were recorded in the GenBank database of known genes in the human genome [257128].
11250704	Tyrosine kinase signalling in breast cancer.	Cells are continuously exposed to diverse stimuli ranging from soluble endocrine and paracrine factors to signalling molecules on neighbouring cells. Receptors of the tyrosine kinase family play an important role in the integration and interpretation of these external stimuli, allowing a cell to respond appropriately to its environment. The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is tightly controlled, allowing a normal cell to correctly integrate its external environment with internal signal transduction pathways. In contrast, due to numerous molecular alterations arising during the course of malignancy, a tumour is characterized by an abnormal response to its environment, which allows cancer cells to evade the normal mechanisms controlling cellular proliferation. Alterations in the expression of various RTKs, in their activation, and in the signalling molecules lying downstream of the receptors play important roles in the development of cancer. This topic is the major focus of the thematic review section of this issue of Breast Cancer Research.
