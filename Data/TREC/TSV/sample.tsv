10869235	SNPing away at complex diseases: analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms around APOE in Alzheimer disease.	There has been great interest in the prospects of using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the search for complex disease genes, and several initiatives devoted to the identification and mapping of SNPs throughout the human genome are currently underway. However, actual data investigating the use of SNPs for identification of complex disease genes are scarce. To begin to look at issues surrounding the use of SNPs in complex disease studies, we have initiated a collaborative SNP mapping study around APOE, the well-established susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). Sixty SNPs in a 1.5-Mb region surrounding APOE were genotyped in samples of unrelated cases of AD, in controls, and in families with AD. Standard tests were conducted to look for association of SNP alleles with AD, in cases and controls. We also used family-based association analyses, including recently developed methods to look for haplotype association. Evidence of association (P</=.05) was identified for 7 of 13 SNPs, including the APOE-4 polymorphism, spanning 40 kb on either side of APOE. As expected, very strong evidence for association with AD was seen for the APOE-4 polymorphism, as well as for two other SNPs that lie <16 kb from APOE. Haplotype analysis using family data increased significance over that seen in single-locus tests for some of the markers, and, for these data, improved localization of the gene. Our results demonstrate that associations can be detected at SNPs near a complex disease gene. We found that a high density of markers will be necessary in order to have a good chance of including SNPs with detectable levels of allelic association with the disease mutation, and statistical analysis based on haplotypes can provide additional information with respect to tests of significance and fine localization of complex disease genes.
14621724	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) excretion as a factor in the severity of CMV disease in kidney and simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation.	The aim of the study was to evaluate the virological parameters associated with the severity of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in renal and simultaneous renal and pancreatic transplantation. The association of the viral profile and the severity of the viral disease was analysed taking into account different confounding variables susceptible to linkage with the severity of the CMV infection and the viral parameters. All the patients transplanted between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1990, a total of 242, were prospectively followed by viral cultures in blood and urine and by serological methods using the detection of CMV-specific IgM and the complement fixation (CF) test. The samples were taken systematically each week for the first month and then at day 90, 180 and every 6 months and also in cases of clinical manifestations related to viral disease. CMV infection was diagnosed virologically by the presence of viraemia, viruria, IgM, or a significant rise in CMV antibody titre in CF. CMV disease was classified as asymptomatic, mild (fever and/or leukopenia), moderate (fever, leukopenia and liver abnormalities), severe (CMV pneumopathy and/or gastrointestinal disease) or fatal. The incidence of CMV infection was 65% (157/242): 32% asymptomatic, 36% mild, 30% moderate and 2% severe. The presence of IgM was associated with the severity of CMV disease: 51.4% of moderate and severe CMV infections in the group with IgM versus only 16% in the group without IgM (P < 0.0001). The risk of having severe or moderate CMV disease was 3.28 times higher in patients with positive IgM. However the serological changes in CF were not significantly associated with the severity of the viral disease since 34.6% of the patients with CF changes had a severe form versus 20.8% in the group without CF modification. Viruria was significantly associated with moderate or severe infection: 43.6% of the patients with viruria had severe infection versus only 12.5% in the patients without viruria (P < 0.0002). The risk of having moderate or severe CMV disease was 3.48 times higher in the patients with viruria. Viraemia was also associated with more severe CMV infection: 48.6% of moderate or severe CMV infection in the group of patients with viraemia versus 19% in the group without viraemia (P < 0.0001). The risk of having severe or moderate CMV infection was 2.58 times higher in the patients with viraemia. Viraemia was not more associated with severe CMV infection than viruria. Using the maximum likelihood ratio method and the logistic regression model, CMV-specific IgM, viruria and viraemia were each shown to be associated with the severity of CMV disease and the addition of one parameter to the other(s), whatever the type (except the CF changes) and whatever the order of this addition, did not remove the link between the severity and IgM, viruria and viremia. The incidence of severe and moderate CMV disease increased with the number of positive viral parameters (PVP) from 2% of moderate and severe infections in the group with one PVP, to 28% in the group with two PVP, to 39% in the group with three PVP and 68% in the group with four PVP (trend, 35.95; P < 0.0001). Taking the absolute risk of the group of patients without IgM, viruria or viraemia as the basal level, the observed relative risk of severe CMV infection varied from 6.45 in the group with positive IgM without viruria or viraemia, to 10.74 in the group with positive IgM and viruria without viraemia and to 22.5 in the group with the three positive parameters IgM, viruria and viraemia. The different potential confounding factors (recipient and donor serology, renal or renal and pancreatic transplantation, DR compatibility, rejection before CMV infection) did not modify the link between the viral profile and the severity of CMV disease. This study suggests that the severity of CMV disease might be linked to the overspread of the virus as well as to the consequences of a CMV-specific humoral immune response.
8644457	Prevalence of specific anti-Cryptosporidium IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies in cat sera using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test.	Sera from 258 healthy and sick domestic and feral cats were screened for specific anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFA). Sera were positive for IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies in 192 (74%), 84 (32%) and 67 (26%) samples, respectively. Antibody was not detected at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20 or greater in any of eight specific pathogen-free kittens. IgM and IgA antibody classes were more prevalent in sick than in healthy domestic cats. The presence of IgM and/or IgA antibodies indicated early infection. However, these antibody classes were present in sera from cats either positive or negative for Cryptosporidium infection by faecal examination. Pronounced polar fluorescence was observed in the sporozoites in positive samples under fluorescence microscopy. The higher prevalence of specific anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies and the absence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in faecal samples from some IFA-positive animals suggests that detection of these antibodies in sera from cats could be helpful for the diagnosis of feline cryptosporidiosis.
12514215	Genetic modulation of tau phosphorylation in the mouse.	The axonal microtubule stabilizing protein tau is hyperphosphorylated in several neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, yet the genes that regulate tau phosphorylation are largely unknown. Disabled-1 (Dab1) is a cytoplasmic adapter protein that interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) receptors and controls neuronal positioning during embryonic brain development. We have investigated the role of Dab1 in tau phosphorylation. We found that wild-type Dab1, but not a mutant lacking tyrosine phosphorylation sites, protects mice from the hyperphosphorylation of tau. However, the absence of Dab1 is not sufficient to cause tau hyperphosphorylation, because hyperphosphorylation is manifested only when Dab1 is mutated in specific mouse strain backgrounds. Tau hyperphosphorylation correlates with early death in susceptible mouse strains, and it occurs in the neurons of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. By quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of Dab1-deficient mice on a hybrid strain background, we uncovered one significant and three suggestive chromosomal loci that modulate tau phosphorylation. Two of these QTL regions contain genes that are defective in early onset Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that Dab1 gene disruption sensitizes mice to tau hyperphosphorylation contingent on specific haplotypes that are linked to Alzheimer's disease loci. Dab1 mutant mice provide an animal model for studying the relationships between ApoE receptors, tau hyperphosphorylation, and Alzheimer's disease.
11583633	Molecular mechanisms mediating methylation-dependent silencing of ribosomal gene transcription.	Epigenetic control mechanisms silence about half of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) in metabolically active cells. In the mouse, 40% of rDNA repeats are methylated and can be activated by 5-azacytidine treatment. In exploring the effect of methylation on rDNA transcription, we found that methylation of a single CpG dinucleotide within the upstream control element of the rDNA promoter (at -133) abrogates rDNA transcription both in transfection experiments and in in vitro assays using chromatin templates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that methylation of the cytosine at -133 inhibits binding of the transcription factor UBF to nucleosomal rDNA, thereby preventing initiation complex formation. Thus, methylation may be a mechanism to inactivate rDNA genes and propagate transcriptional silencing through cell division.
9648104	Culture methods for selective growth of normal rat and human Schwann cells.	Beginning with an introduction of the Schwann cell itself, this chapter provides detailed methodology for growing pure Schwann cells of rat and human origin in serum-free medium without complicated cell purification schemes. Section II lists the essential preexperiment preparations such as materials, instruments, tissue culture medium, and solutions. Section III begins with the procedure for the dissection of embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from E14-E15 rat embryos, neonatal rats, and adult rats with diagrams; methods for enzymatic dissociation of the DRGs and the initiation of primary culture follow. A description of primary cultures with photographs is also provided for comparison. This section ends with a protocol for and results expected of serial passaging of rat Schwann cells. Section IV carefully describes the culture of Schwann cells from human adult nerve biopsy, a procedure that produces a thousandfold expansion of human Schwann cells within a month from initial plating. In the last section, basic immunocytochemistry as well as advanced in vitro remyelination techniques are provided for biochemical and functional characterization of Schwann cell cultures.
12209019	Comparison of different labeling methods for two-channel high-density microarray experiments.	In this report we evaluate three methods for labeling nucleic acids to be hybridized to a cDNA microarray: direct labeling, indirect amino-allyl labeling, and the dendrimer labeling method (Genisphere). The dendrimer method requires the smallest quantity of sample, 2.5 microg of total RNA compared with 20 microg with the direct or indirect methods. Therefore, we wanted to know whether the performance of the dendrimer method is comparable to the other methods, or whether significant information is lost. Performance can be considered in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, and reproducibility of the quantitative signals for gene intensity. We compared the three labeling methods by generating three sets of eight self-to-self hybridizations using the same total RNA sample in all cases ("replicate study"). In our analysis, we controlled for the effects of print-tip and background subtraction biases. We also performed a smaller study, namely, a dilution series study with five dilution points per labeling method, to evaluate one aspect of predictive ability. From the replicate study, the dendrimer method appeared to perform as well, and often better, with respect to reproducibility and ability to detect expression. However, in the dilution series study, this method was outperformed by the other two in terms of predictive ability and did not perform very well. These findings are helping to guide our decisions on what labeling method to use for subsequent studies, based on the purpose of a specific study and its limitations in terms of available material.
10655498	Toward a protein-protein interaction map of the budding yeast: A comprehensive system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between the yeast proteins.	Protein-protein interactions play pivotal roles in various aspects of the structural and functional organization of the cell, and their complete description is indispensable to thorough understanding of the cell. As an approach toward this goal, here we report a comprehensive system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all of the possible combinations between proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We cloned all of the yeast ORFs individually as a DNA-binding domain fusion ("bait") in a MATa strain and as an activation domain fusion ("prey") in a MATalpha strain, and subsequently divided them into pools, each containing 96 clones. These bait and prey clone pools were systematically mated with each other, and the transformants were subjected to strict selection for the activation of three reporter genes followed by sequence tagging. Our initial examination of approximately 4 x 10(6) different combinations, constituting approximately 10% of the total to be tested, has revealed 183 independent two-hybrid interactions, more than half of which are entirely novel. Notably, the obtained binary data allow us to extract more complex interaction networks, including the one that may explain a currently unsolved mechanism for the connection between distinct steps of vesicular transport. The approach described here thus will provide many leads for integration of various cellular functions and serve as a major driving force in the completion of the protein-protein interaction map.
11934887	The human papillomavirus 16 E6 protein binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) R1 and protects cells from TNF-induced apoptosis.	High risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), such as HPV 16, cause human cervical carcinoma. The E6 protein of HPV 16 mediates the rapid degradation of p53, although this is not the only function of E6 and cannot completely explain its transforming potential. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that transfection of HPV 16 E6 into the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-sensitive LM cell line protects expressing cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner, and the purpose of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying this protection. Caspase 3 and caspase 8 activation were significantly reduced in E6-expressing cells, indicating that E6 acts early in the TNF apoptotic pathway. In fact, E6 binds directly to TNF R1, as shown both by co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid approaches. E6 requires the same C-terminal portion of TNF R1 for binding as does TNF R1-associated death domain, and TNF R1/TNF R1-associated death domain interactions are decreased in the presence of E6. HA-E6 also blocked cell death triggered by transfection of the death domain of TNF R1. Together, these results provide strong support for a model in which HPV E6 binding to TNF R1 interferes with formation of the death-inducing signaling complex and thus with transduction of proapoptotic signals. They also demonstrate that HPV, like several other viruses, has developed a method for evading the TNF-mediated host immune response.
11389480	Microarrays in brain research: the good, the bad and the ugly.	Making sense of microarray data is a complex process, in which the interpretation of findings will depend on the overall experimental design and judgement of the investigator performing the analysis. As a result, differences in tissue harvesting, microarray types, sample labelling and data analysis procedures make post hoc sharing of microarray data a great challenge. To ensure rapid and meaningful data exchange, we need to create some order out of the existing chaos. In these ground-breaking microarray standardization and data sharing efforts, NIH agencies should take a leading role
9096391	The CAG repeat within the androgen receptor gene and its relationship to prostate cancer.	The length of a polymorphic CAG repeat sequence, occurring in the androgen receptor gene, is inversely correlated with transcriptional activity by the androgen receptor. Because heightened androgenic stimulation may increase risk of prostate cancer development and progression, we examined whether shorter CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene are related to higher risk of prostate cancer. We conducted a nested case-control study of 587 newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer detected between 1982 and 1995, and 588 controls without prostate cancer, within the Physician's Health Study. An association existed between fewer androgen receptor gene CAG repeats and higher risk of total prostate cancer [relative risk (RR) = 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.92-2.49; P trend = 0.04; for men with CAG repeat lengths < or = 18 relative to > or = 26 repeats]. In particular, a shorter CAG repeat sequence was associated with cancers characterized by extraprostatic extension or distant metastases (stage C or D) or high histologic grade (RR = 2.14; CI = 1.14-4.01; P trend = 0.001). This association was observed individually both for high stage (RR = 2.23) and high grade prostate cancer (RR = 1.89). Men with shorter repeats were at particularly high risk for distant metastatic and fatal prostate cancer. Variability in the CAG repeat length was not associated with low grade or low stage disease. These results demonstrate that a shorter CAG repeat sequence in the androgen receptor gene predicts higher grade and advanced stage of prostate cancer at diagnosis, and metastasis and mortality from the disease. The clinical implications of these results should be evaluated further.
12885466	Allelic imbalance in colorectal cancer at the CRAC1 locus in early-onset colorectal cancer.	A susceptibility gene to colorectal adenomas and carcinoma (CRAC1) on chromosome region 15q14 approximately q22 has been proposed on the basis of linkage in a single family. Allele-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors of affected family members suggests that the causative gene functions as a tumor-suppressor gene. The genes that are mutated in inherited cancer syndromes are often involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic cancer. To determine whether CRAC1 plays a role in colorectal carcinogenesis in general, we have studied 277 cases of early-onset colorectal cancers for allele loss at 15q14 approximately q22 using four microsatellite markers (D15S970, D15S117, D15S971, and D15S1028) that define the region of maximal linkage. The frequency of LOH detected was between 14% and 22%, but there was no significant association between LOH at each adjacent marker. Most cancers caused by loss of expression of a tumor suppressor involve large-scale deletion of one allele. On this basis, our findings suggest that CRAC1 is unlikely to be implicated in the development of colorectal cancer in general or, if involved, it is through small somatic mutations or other loss of function mechanisms rather than allele loss.
7765058	Extension of incomplete cDNAs (ESTs) by biotin/streptavidin-mediated walking using the polymerase chain reaction.	In the last 2 years thousands of new partial cDNAs or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been identified by single pass sequencing methods. It is expected that this number will further increase in order to help to isolate all human genes. However, the scientific value of partial cDNA fragments is limited unless they are used as tools for isolating and sequencing their full length parent molecules. Conventional library screening methods are tedious and not very effective in achieving this goal. We present a modified PCR technique which allows rapid isolation of the ends of partial cDNA fragments in vitro using a biotin/streptavidin capture procedure. Our method has several advantages over the RACE technique, is very specific, and allows to frequently sequence the final product directly without subcloning. We also show that cDNA walks can be obtained from partial sequences as short as 26 bp.
7960817	CATS: opportunities through open learning.	Health visitors need time out from their routine workload and encouragement from managers to reflect on their role in relation to their clients' needs. This is particularly important in times of great change. Stevie Holland describes how the new HVA open learning packs, to be re-launched in September, can help this process, and how practitioners can use them to gain further professional and academic qualifications through the credit accumulation and transfer scheme.
10503135	Pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis gene mutations.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease with multisystem involvement in which defective chloride transport across membranes causes dehydrated secretions. The protein encoded by the CF gene--the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)--functions as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated chloride channel. The ability to detect CFTR mutations has led to the recognition of its association with a variety of conditions, including chronic bronchitis, sinusitis with nasal polyps, pancreatitis, and, in men, infertility. This article reviews the impact of CF on the pancreas, the role of the CFTR protein in pancreatic secretion, and some of the exciting research identifying mutations in the CFTR gene as a risk factor for idiopathic acute and chronic pancreatitis.
9511817	Cell proliferation enhances entry of Listeria monocytogenes into intestinal epithelial cells by two proliferation-dependent entry pathways.	Bacterial entry into intestinal host cells is the result of a fairly sophisticated manipulation of host cell machinery by the pathogens. To study further the potential cell target of Listeria spp., the in-vitro entry of L. monocytogenes strains into intestinal cells was examined in relation to the metabolism, proliferation and differentiation of the cells by the alamarBlue assay, [3H] thymidine incorporation, and brush border-associated enzyme activities, respectively. The study showed that cell metabolism was not involved in the entry of L. monocytogenes in three cell models (two human and one porcine). On the other hand, entry was closely related to the proliferation process and poorly related to the differentiation state of the cells. The use of L. monocytogenes mutants lacking invasion proteins showed that InlA and InlB acted in synergy to mediate the entry of L. monocytogenes into proliferative cells, whereas InlA alone seemed to be involved in the entry into non-proliferative cells. These two entry pathways could correspond to the two cellular processes used by L. monocytogenes to enter proliferative and non-proliferative cells, as suggested by the use of cytochalasin D, nocodazole, chloroquine and monodansylcadaverine. Taken together, we propose a hypothesis in which the entry of L. monocytogenes is mediated by interaction between randomly distributed E-cadherin on the surface of proliferative cells. In contrast, the entry into non-proliferative cells may involve pp60c-src, a proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase signal that modifies E-cadherin localisation. In conclusion, these results suggest that L. monocytogenes may preferentially enter crypt cells in vivo by a microfilament-dependent process, whereas the few bacteria that infect villus cells enter by an E-cadherin-internalin interaction that mediates microtubule-dependent endocytosis.
11483959	Valosin-containing protein is a multi-ubiquitin chain-targeting factor required in ubiquitin-proteasome degradation.	The ubiquitin-proteasome (Ub-Pr) degradation pathway regulates many cellular activities, but how ubiquitinated substrates are targeted to the proteasome is not understood. We have shown previously that valosin-containing protein (VCP) physically and functionally targets the ubiquitinated nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor, IkappaBalpha to the proteasome for degradation. VCP is an abundant and a highly conserved member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family. Besides acting as a chaperone in membrane fusions, VCP has been shown to have a role in a number of seemingly unrelated cellular activities. Here we report that loss of VCP function results in an inhibition of Ub-Pr-mediated degradation and an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. VCP associates with ubiquitinated proteins through the direct binding of its amino-terminal domain to the multi-ubiquitin chains of substrates. Furthermore, its N-terminal domain is required in Ub-Pr-mediated degradation. We conclude that VCP is a multi-ubiquitin chain-targeting factor that is required in the degradation of many Ub-Pr pathway substrates, and provide a common mechanism that underlies many of the functions of VCP.
7989485	Identification and functional characterization of two new somatic mutations causing constitutive activation of the thyrotropin receptor in hyperfunctioning autonomous adenomas of the thyroid.	It has recently been shown that somatic and germ line mutations of the TSH receptor gene cause autonomous hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas and nonautoimmune toxic thyroid hyperplasia by constitutive activation of the TSH receptor. A "saturated" map of these mutations is a prerequisite for a systematic screening for these clinically important mutations. In this context, it is also of interest to determine whether different amino acid substitutions at the same residue cause constitutive activation of the TSH receptor, as suggested by site-directed mutagenesis of the alpha 1 beta-adrenergic receptor. We, therefore, screened further hyperfunctioning autonomous adenomas of the thyroid for constitutively activating mutations. We identified two new somatic mutations, changing alanine in position 623 to valine (A623V) and threonine in position 632 to isoleucine (T632I). Both mutations constitutively activated cAMP when transiently expressed in COS cells. Together with neighboring mutations, the T632I mutation demonstrates the importance of transmembrane domain VI for the activation of the TSH receptor and characterizes it as a hot spot for constitutively activating mutations. The previously identified A623I and the newly identified A623V mutations demonstrate that several amino acid substitutions at the same residue can cause constitutive activation of the TSH receptor.
9422818	The interaction of general anaesthetics with recombinant GABAA and glycine receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes: a comparative study.	1. The effects of five structurally dissimilar general anaesthetics were examined in voltage-clamp recordings of agonist-evoked currents mediated by recombinant gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors composed of human alpha 1 beta 1 and gamma 2L subunits expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. A quantitative comparison of the effects of these agents was made upon recombinant glycine receptors expressed as a homo-oligomer of human alpha 1 subunits, or as a hetero-oligomer of human alpha 1 and rat beta subunits. 2. Complementary RNA-injected oocytes expressing GABAA receptors responded to bath applied GABA with an EC50 of 158 +/- 34 microM. Oocytes expressing alpha 1 and alpha 1 beta glycine receptors subsequent to cDNA injection displayed EC50 values of 76 +/- 2 microM and 66 +/- 2 microM, respectively, in response to bath applied glycine. 3. Picrotoxin antagonized responses mediated by homo-oligomeric alpha 1 glycine receptors with an IC50 of 4.2 +/- 0.8 microM. Hetero-oligomeric alpha 1 beta glycine receptors were at least 100-fold less sensitive to blockade by picrotoxin. 4. With the appropriate agonist EC10, propofol enhanced GABA and glycine-evoked currents to approximately the maximal response produced by a saturating concentration of either agonist (i.e. Imax). The calculated EC50 values were 2.3 +/- 0.2 microM, 16 +/- 3 microM and 27 +/- 2 microM, for GABAA alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L, glycine alpha 1 and alpha 1 beta receptors, respectively. At relatively high concentrations, propofol was observed to activate directly both GABAA and glycine receptors. 5. Pentobarbitone potentiated GABA-evoked currents to 117 +/- 8.5% of Imax with an EC50 of 65 +/- 3 microM. The barbiturate also produced a substantial enhancement of the glycine-evoked currents, Imax and EC50 values being 71 +/- 2% and 845 +/- 66 microM and 51 +/- 10% and 757 +/- 30 microM for homomeric alpha 1 and heteromeric alpha 1 beta glycine receptors respectively. At high concentrations, pentobarbitone directly activated GABAA, but not glycine, receptors. 6. The potentiation by propofol or pentobarbitone of currents mediated by alpha 1 homo-oligomeric glycine receptors was in both cases associated with a parallel sinistral shift of the glycine concentration-effect curve. The effects of binary combinations of pentobarbitone and propofol at maximally effective concentrations were mutually occlusive suggesting a common site, or mechanism, of action. 7. GABA-evoked currents were maximally potentiated by etomidate to 79 +/- 2% of Imax (EC50 of 8.1 +/- 0.9 microM). By contrast, glycine-induced currents mediated by alpha 1 and alpha 1 beta glycine receptor isoforms were enhanced only to 29 +/- 4% and 28 +/- 3% of Imax. Limited solubility precluded the calculation of EC50 values for the effect of etomidate at glycine receptors. None of the receptor isoforms examined were directly activated by etomidate. 8. The neurosteroid 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one potentiated GABA-evoked currents to 69 +/- 4% of Imax, with an EC50 value of 89 +/- 6 nM. In contrast, both alpha 1 homo-oligomeric and alpha 1 beta hetero-oligomeric glycine receptors were insensitive to the action of this steroid. A direct agonist action of the steroid was discernible at GABAA, but not glycine, receptors. 9. Trichloroethanol, the active metabolite of the general anaesthetic chloral hydrate, enhanced glycine-evoked currents to 77 +/- 10% and 94 +/- 4% of Imax on alpha 1 and alpha 1 beta glycine receptors, with EC50 values of 3.5 +/- 0.1 mM and 5.9 +/- 0.3 mM respectively. On GABAA receptors, trichloroethanol had a lower maximum enhancement (52 +/- 5% of Imax), but a slightly higher potency (EC50 1.0 +/- 0.1 mM). Trichloroethanol activated neither GABAA, nor glycine, receptors. 10. The data demonstrate a variety of intravenous general anaesthetic agents, at clinically relevant concentrations, to augment preferentially GABA-evoked currents mediated by the alpha1beta1upsilon2L receptor subunit combination as compared to their effects on both alpha1 and alpha1beta glycine receptors. However, the presence on glycine receptors of lower affinity modulatory binding sites for pentobarbitone, propofol and trichloroethanol may aid in the identification of the molecular determinants of the CNS actions of these anaesthetics.
8069001	Interferon beta for multiple sclerosis.	OBJECTIVE: To introduce readers to the use of a new agent, interferon beta-1b (IFN beta ser), in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Therapeutic and economic issues surrounding IFN beta ser are discussed, as are its pharmacology, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage guidelines. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was used to identify pertinent literature, including clinical trials and reviews. STUDY SELECTIONS: All available trials were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Since trials evaluating subcutaneously administered interferon beta are sparse, clinical trials evaluating intrathecal IFN beta ser were included, as was toxicology information from the oncology population. DATA SYNTHESIS: IFN beta ser has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of RRMS. Its exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it may downregulate interferon gamma (IFN gamma) production and the IFN gamma-stimulated major histocompatibility complex antigen expression, and/or augment T-suppressor cell function. Primary adverse effects include flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, myalgia, sweating, and injection-site reactions. Clinical efficacy has been investigated in 372 ambulatory patients with RRMS. IFN beta ser treatment resulted in a reduction in the annual exacerbation rate and a greater proportion of exacerbation-free patients. Burden of central nervous system disease was also significantly reduced in treated patients. However, no reductions were detected on the Scripps Neurologic Rating Scale or with confirmed endpoint scores on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale. Although many questions remain concerning IFN beta ser's long-term efficacy, its benefits in patients with other types of multiple sclerosis (MS), and its effect on progression of disease and ultimate disability, IFN beta ser is the first treatment modality that has substantially altered the natural course of MS in a controlled clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: IFN beta ser is not a cure for MS, but it is well tolerated and patients with RRMS have shown significant improvements in exacerbation rates and burden of central nervous system disease. IFN beta ser should be considered a definite improvement in RRMS treatment, although many therapeutic issues remain unanswered. Additional clinical trials are needed.
7925459	Structural comparison of phospholipase-A2-binding regions in phospholipase-A2 receptors from various mammals.	We determined the nucleotide sequence of a mouse cDNA encoding the receptor for pancreatic group I phospholipase A2 (PLA2-I). Interspecies structural comparison of the mouse receptor with bovine PLA2-I receptor, whose structure had been clarified, revealed that the fourth carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD)-like domain (CRD-like 4) was the most conserved among the domains in the PLA2-I receptor, suggesting the functional importance of CRD-like 4. A transient expression experiment with a truncated form of the receptor consisting of three CRD-like domains, from the third to the fifth, demonstrated that the PLA2-I-binding site of the receptor is constituted from these three CRD-like domains, supporting the functional indispensability of CRD-like 4 in the receptor. Since the PLA2-I-binding region was thus assigned to be CRD-like domains 3-5, we further analyzed the structures of the PLA2-I-binding regions in the PLA2-I receptors from the rat, rabbit and human. Furthermore, the obtained PLA2-I receptor cDNA fragments from these animals made it possible to examine the tissue expression patterns of this receptor in various mammals. The results, together with the results of the genomic structural analysis of this gene, indicated that a PLA2 receptor recently characterized by Lambeau et al. [Lambeau, G., Ancian, P., Barhanin, J. & Lazdunski, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1575-1578] is a rabbit counterpart of the PLA2-I receptor although these two PLA2 receptors have distinctive PLA2-binding specificities.
10985947	Theory and in vivo application of electroporative gene delivery.	Efficient and safe methods for delivering exogenous genetic material into tissues must be developed before the clinical potential of gene therapy will be realized. Recently, in vivo electroporation has emerged as a leading technology for developing nonviral gene therapies and nucleic acid vaccines (NAV). Electroporation (EP) involves the application of pulsed electric fields to cells to enhance cell permeability, resulting in exogenous polynucleotide transit across the cytoplasmic membrane. Similar pulsed electrical field treatments are employed in a wide range of biotechnological processes including in vitro EP, hybridoma production, development of transgenic animals, and clinical electrochemotherapy. Electroporative gene delivery studies benefit from well-developed literature that may be used to guide experimental design and interpretation. Both theory and experimental analysis predict that the critical parameters governing EP efficacy include cell size and field strength, duration, frequency, and total number of applied pulses. These parameters must be optimized for each tissue in order to maximize gene delivery while minimizing irreversible cell damage. By providing an overview of the theory and practice of electroporative gene transfer, this review intends to aid researchers that wish to employ the method for preclinical and translational gene therapy, NAV, and functional genomic research.
11857676	Glutathione S-transferase isoenzymes in the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).	Isoenzymes of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in adult Adalia bipunctata, an aphidophagous predator, were studied. Cytosolic GST activity was studied in each beetle developmental stage. The highest activities towards both 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 2,4-dinitro-1-iodobenzene (DNIB) occurred in adults. The enzyme distribution was investigated in adults. While most of the enzymatic activity was found in the abdomen (40-50 and 34-63% respectively) using several concentrations of both CDNB and DNIB, significant differences were observed for the head and the thorax depending on the substrate. Activities were more abundant in the thorax with DNIB (37-47%) compared to the 13-19% obtained with CDNB. Some GST activity was also detected in the elytra. GSTs were purified by epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B affinity chromatography and applied to an HPLC column to determine the native molecular weight (69 kDa). Three isoenzymes were separated by chromatofocusing at pH ranges 7-4. Three bands with molecular mass from 23 to 26 kDa were visualised on SDS-PAGE. Their isoelectric points were 6.66, 6.36, and 6.21. The substrate specificities and the kinetic parameters (Vm and Km) of the isoenzymes showed large differences depending on the isoenzyme. Arch.
11396172	Suppression activity of pro-apoptotic gene products in cancer cells, a potential application for cancer gene therapy.	Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins may play a role in the development of resistance to cancer therapy. We examined the expression of these proteins in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer cells. We found that some of these cancer cell lines expressed high levels of Bcl-XL or Bcl-2., In order to develop an effective strategy to overcome the potential inhibition of cancer therapy by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, we tested the inhibitory ability of several pro-apoptotic or tumor suppressor genes in these cells. The expression of these genes induced apoptosis or suppressed cell growth with variable efficiency in these cells. Harakiri (Hrk) appears to result in the greatest induction of apoptosis or inhibition of cell growth Mtd, bax and bcl-XS were also effective in inhibiting cell growth. Furthermore, transfection of Hrk, bax, or Mtd into these cells caused significantly less colony formation than in cells transfected with p53 or BRCA1. Therefore, these results suggest that Hrk, bax, and Mtd are potent therapeutic agents for cancers expressing high levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL.
7553620	bcl-2 suppresses expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 in breast epithelial cells.	The tumor suppressor gene p53 regulates G1 checkpoint prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis, which can either induce G1 arrest or signal apoptosis. The involvement of p53 in apoptosis may also be related to its ability to down-regulate transcription of the bcl-2 gene. The bcl-2 gene product prevents most types of apoptotic cell death, suggesting that bcl-2 interferes with an essential signaling molecule involved in the apoptotic cell death pathway. Although the bcl-2 protein is shown to be overexpressed in many types of human tumor including breast cancer, its biochemical or pathological consequences are poorly understood. To determine the effects of bcl-2 overexpression on apoptosis and transformation of breast epithelial cells and to investigate whether bcl-2 interferes with the p53 pathway, we introduced the bcl-2 expression vector into MCF10A cells, which were derived from diploid human breast epithelial cells containing the wild-type p53 gene. Overexpression of bcl-2 prevented free radical-induced apoptosis and induced a partially transformed phenotype in MCF10A cells. Although overexpression of bcl-2 did not affect the expression of the p53 gene, p53-dependent gene transcription such as p21WAF1/CIP1 was suppressed. These results suggest that bcl-2 may inhibit p53 functional activity and is involved in the regulation of an early commitment step either to proliferate or suicide.
9889352	Molecular cloning of human GABABR1 and its tissue distribution.	GABABR1 clones were isolated from a human cerebellum library. The human sequence is very similar to rat GABABR1 with the cDNAs sharing 91.3% sequence identity and the receptors sharing 98.6% amino acid sequence identity. Northern blotting has shown that the receptor is brain-specific with a widespread distribution throughout the brain but none detected in the spinal cord.
10953028	Gastrin is a target of the beta-catenin/TCF-4 growth-signaling pathway in a model of intestinal polyposis.	Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene occur in most colorectal cancers and lead to activation of beta-catenin. Whereas several downstream targets of beta-catenin have been identified (c-myc, cyclin D1, PPARdelta), the precise functional significance of many of these targets has not been examined directly using genetic approaches. Previous studies have shown that the gene encoding the hormone gastrin is activated during colon cancer progression and the less-processed forms of gastrin are important colonic trophic factors. We show here that the gastrin gene is a downstream target of the beta-catenin/TCF-4 signaling pathway and that cotransfection of a constitutively active beta-catenin expression construct causes a threefold increase in gastrin promoter activity. APC(min-/+) mice overexpressing one of the alternatively processed forms of gastrin, glycine-extended gastrin, show a significant increase in polyp number. Gastrin-deficient APC(min-/+) mice, conversely, showed a marked decrease in polyp number and a significantly decreased polyp proliferation rate. Activation of gastrin by beta-catenin may therefore represent an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis and may contribute significantly toward neoplastic progression. The identification of gastrin as a functionally relevant downstream target of the beta-catenin signaling pathway provides a new target for therapeutic modalities in the treatment of colorectal cancer.
9015311	Adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein has signaling activity in Xenopus laevis embryos resulting in the induction of an ectopic dorsoanterior axis.	Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene are linked to both familial and sporadic human colon cancer. So far, a clear biological function for the APC gene product has not been determined. We assayed the activity of APC in the early Xenopus embryo, which has been established as a good model for the analysis of the signaling activity of the APC-associated protein beta-catenin. When expressed in the future ventral side of a four-cell embryo, full-length APC induced a secondary dorsoanterior axis and the induction of the homeobox gene Siamois. This is similar to the phenotype previously observed for ectopic beta-catenin expression. In fact, axis induction by APC required the availability of cytosolic beta-catenin. These results indicate that APC has signaling activity in the early Xenopus embryo. Signaling activity resides in the central domain of the protein, a part of the molecule that is missing in most of the truncating APC mutations in colon cancer. Signaling by APC in Xenopus embryos is not accompanied by detectable changes in expression levels of beta-catenin, indicating that it has direct positive signaling activity in addition to its role in beta-catenin turnover. From these results we propose a model in which APC acts as part of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, either upstream of, or in conjunction with, beta-catenin.
11197304	The interferon gene cluster: a candidate region for MS predisposition? Multiple Sclerosis Study Group.	The clinical benefits of interferon (IFN) beta therapy in some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are still unexplained, raising the question whether polymorphism within the IFNB gene itself would provide an explanation. Screening the IFNB gene by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing, a single nucleotide polymorphism was identified. Both alleles were distributed with similar frequencies in MS patients and controls. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the IFN allele [153C] and allele [02] of the previously analyzed IFNA microsatellite (Epplen et al. Ann Neurol 1997; 41: 341-352) was observed in MS patients only, indicating a disease related haplotype. On the other hand an increased risk (RR = 12.41; Pc < 8 x 10(-5)) was observed for allele [07]. Hence the study was extended to neighbouring genes. Functionally relevant polymorphisms, i.e., premature stop codons in the IFNA10 [Cys20Stop] and IFNA17 [58Stop] genes and an aminoacid (aa) substitution [ile 184Arg] in the IFNA17 gene were analyzed. Patients carrying a non-functional IFNA17 allele bear an increased risk to develop MS (RR = 25.68; Pc < 0.06). In addition, LD analysis between IFNA10 [Cys20Stop], IFNA17 [58Stop] and the IFNA microsatellite alleles provides evidence for IFNA14, IFNA16 or IFNA5 as additional, most likely candidate genes. The present study excludes the IFNB gene as a candidate for MS predisposition but provides first evidence for predisposing IFNA genes.
8260365	p53 expression and its relationship to DNA alterations in bone and soft tissue sarcomas.	The p53 gene is one of the best studied tumour suppressor genes. Recently we performed mutation analysis on the p53 gene in a large number of bone and soft tissue sarcomas, and found that approximately one-third of the sarcomas have some type of DNA alteration at the p53 locus (Toguchida et al., 1992). However, the expression of the p53 protein resulting from these alterations still remains to be clarified. In this study, p53 expression in the sarcoma tissues was analysed immunohistochemically using antibody PAb421 (Oncogene Science) and its relationship to DNA alterations was examined. Of 113 tumours, 29 (25.7%) showed positive staining for the p53 protein. These included 19 of 67 osteosarcomas, five of 20 chondrosarcomas, four of 11 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs) and one Ewing's sarcoma. In chondrosarcomas, most of the p53-positive tumours belonged to highly malignant and atypical tumour types (dedifferentiated or mesenchymal type), suggesting a role for p53 mutation in the progression of cartilaginous tumours. All the cases with a missense mutation showed strongly positive staining, while no immunoreactivity was observed in the remaining three-quarters with DNA alterations including gross rearrangement, frame-shift mutation, nonsense mutation or mutation at splicing site except in one case. These results demonstrated the dominance of the p53 mutations with null protein expression in bone and soft tissue sarcomas, showing a unique characteristic of these types of tumours compared with other malignancies such as colon carcinomas.
8960250	Activity of glutathione-dependent enzymes in long term diabetes. I. Activity of glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase in the liver of alloxan induced diabetic rats.	Cytosolic liver glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was decreased for CDNB and DCNB as substrates in long term alloxan induced diabetes. Similar to cytosolic, microsomal glutathione S-transferase activity was also decreased for CDNB. In contrast, both microsomal and cytosolic GST activities for ETA as well as cytosolic and microsomal glutathione (GSH) contents were unaffected. The activity of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity, but not nonSe-dependent peroxidase activity was increased in diabetic rats. The results suggest that diabetic state has a different effect on each isoenzyme of hepatic glutathione S-transferase activity. After insulin treatment of diabetic animals the activities of both cytosolic and microsomal GST was not restored and the activity of non Se-GSHPx was significantly lower than the control value.
10985489	Preparation of macroporous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels by enhanced phase separation.	Macroporous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (p(HEMA)) hydrogels were prepared in the presence of a 0.3-0.7 M NaCl solution. The pore morphology of the p(HEMA) hydrogels was dependent on the concentration of NaCl for a constant monomer solution to aqueous solution ratio. Swelling studies showed an increase in equilibrium water content and hydrogel porosity as the NaCl concentration in the polymerization medium increased from 0 to 0.7 M. The equilibrium water content, however, decreased as the NaCl concentration in the swelling medium increased. The frozen water content increased and non-frozen water decreased with an increase in the NaCl concentration in the polymerization medium. Mechanical testing indicated that the elastic modulus of the hydrogels was not affected by the increased porosity until the pores became interconnected. These data suggest that the addition of NaCl to the polymerization medium results in a multi-phase separation during fabrication that produces macroporous hydrogels of controlled morphology.
9297847	The Spirulina platensis adenylate cyclase gene, cyaC, encodes a novel signal transduction protein.	A cyaC gene encoding an adenylate cyclase of the filamentous cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis was sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of cyaC is similar to the catalytic domains of adenylate cyclases in other cyanobacteria and eukaryotes. The sequences of other regions are similar to those of proteins consisting of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system: the sensory kinase and the response regulator. The predicted gene product of cyaC contains, from the N-terminal end, a receiver domain of the response regulator protein (R1), a domain similar to the ETR1 of Arabidopsis thaliana, a transmitter domain of the sensory kinase protein, a receiver domain of the response regulator protein (R2), and a catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase. The cyaC gene was expressed as an affinity-tagged protein in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified. The purified protein had adenylate cyclase activity which was activated by Mu2+. The results of Western blotting using an anti-CyaC antiserum and the S.platensis cell extract confirmed that cyaC gene is expressed in S. platensis.
8188270	Molecular cloning and chromosomal localization of the human alpha 7-nicotinic receptor subunit gene (CHRNA7).	We have isolated cDNA and genomic clones coding for the human alpha 7 neuronal nicotinic receptor subunit, the major component of brain nicotinic receptors that are blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. The human alpha 7 neuronal nicotinic cDNA encodes a mature protein of 479 amino acids that is highly homologous to the rat alpha 7 neuronal nicotinic subunit (90%). We have mapped the human alpha 7-nicotinic receptor subunit gene to chromosome 15, band q14, a region frequently rearranged in patients carrying a bisatellite 15 chromosome, large inv dup (15), whose clinical features include mental retardation and seizures.
12394279	Acamprosate, MK-801, and ifenprodil inhibit neurotoxicity and calcium entry induced by ethanol withdrawal in organotypic slice cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus.	BACKGROUND: The antirelapse drug acamprosate has previously been reported to inhibit activating effects of polyamines on -methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) function. Because increased synthesis of polyamines has been suggested as a mechanism for potentiation of NMDAR function during ethanol withdrawal, we evaluated the effects of acamprosate, MK-801, and ifenprodil in a cell culture model of ethanol withdrawal-induced neurotoxicity. METHODS: Organotypic hippocampal cultures from 8-day-old neonatal rats were maintained in vitro for 23 days before experimental use. The ethanol withdrawal model consisted of exposing cultures to ethanol (70-100 mM) for 4 days before being "withdrawn" into Calcium-Locke's buffer for 1 hr and then into minimal medium for 23 hr. Uptake of (45)CaCl(2) and propidium iodide by damaged cells was assessed 1 hr and 24 hr after the start of ethanol withdrawal, respectively. Additional studies examined effects of exposure to NMDA (50 microM) or spermidine (100 microM) on withdrawal-induced hippocampal damage. Last, these studies examined the ability of the sodium salt of acamprosate (Na-acamprosate, 200 microM), ifenprodil (50 microM), or MK-801 (30 microM) to inhibit neurotoxicity and (45)Ca(2+) entry produced by these insults. RESULTS: Ethanol withdrawal was associated with significantly greater toxicity and (45)Ca(2+) entry, relative to controls. Exposure to spermidine and NMDA during ethanol withdrawal further increased neurotoxicity and (45)Ca(2+) entry. Acamprosate, ifenprodil, and MK-801 almost completely prevented ethanol withdrawal-induced toxicity and (45)Ca(2+) entry. Acamprosate also reduced spermidine-induced neurotoxicity during ethanol withdrawal but was ineffective against NMDA-induced toxicity or (45)Ca(2+) entry at this time. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the contention that acamprosate, like ifenprodil, interacts with polyamines and that these compounds may be effective in reducing consequences of ethanol withdrawal. NMDAR activation is also strongly implicated in ethanol withdrawal neurotoxicity, but whether acamprosate causes any of these effects in this preparation directly via the NMDAR remains uncertain.
12067714	Direct interaction of Frizzled-1, -2, -4, and -7 with PDZ domains of PSD-95.	In Drosophila, the frizzled gene plays a critical role in the establishment of tissue polarity, but the function of the Frizzled family of proteins in mammals is largely unknown. Recent evidence suggested that Frizzleds are receptors for the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins which are involved in cell fate determination. However, it is unclear how Frizzled receptors transduce Wnt signals to intracellular signaling components. Here we show that the mouse Frizzled-1, -2, -4 and -7 can bind to proteins of the PSD-95 family, which are implicated in the assembly and localization of multiprotein signaling complexes in the brain. Moreover, PSD-95 can form a ternary complex with Frizzled-2 and the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, suggesting that members of the PSD-95 family may serve to recruit intracellular signaling molecules of the Wnt/Frizzled pathway into the vicinity of the receptor.
8764323	Both the wild type and a functional isoform of CFTR are expressed in kidney.	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) consists of five domains, two transmembrane-spanning domains, each composed of six transmembrane segments, a regulatory domain, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). CFTR is expressed in kidney, but its role in overall renal function is not well understood, because mutations in CFTR found in patients with cystic fibrosis are not associated with renal dysfunction. To learn more about the distribution and functional forms of CFTR in kidney, we used a combination of molecular, cell biological, and electrophysiological approaches. These include an evaluation of CFTR mRNA and protein expression, as well as both two-electrode and patch clamping of CFTR expressed either in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. In addition to wild-type CFTR mRNA, an alternate form containing only the first transmembrane domain (TMD), the first NBD, and the regulatory domain (TNR-CFTR) is expressed in kidney. Although missing the second set of TMDs and the second NBD, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, TNR-CFTR has cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-stimulated single Cl- channel characteristics and regulation of PKA activation of outwardly rectifying Cl- channels that are very similar to those of wild-type CFTR. TNR-CFTR mRNA is produced by an unusual mRNA processing mechanism and is expressed in a tissue-specific manner primarily in renal medulla.
9890376	Differential expression of cell survival and cell cycle regulatory proteins in cutaneous squamoproliferative lesions.	Previous models of cutaneous carcinogenesis have primarily focused on the regulation of keratinocyte (KC) proliferation and differentiation. However, it has become clear in many neoplastic systems that altered rates of cell death and/or inability to undergo growth arrest can also contribute to the development of cancer. Apoptosis-regulatory proteins include those that block apoptosis such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, whilst a related protein Bax promotes apoptosis. Cell cycle regulatory proteins include those associated with growth arrest, i.e. p21wafl, p53, and those associated with proliferation, i.e. Ki-67. Paraffin embedded samples from ten different lesions of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen's disease (BD), keratoacanthomas (KA), and nine normal adult skin samples were stained by immunohistochemistry to detect expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bax, Ki-67, p21wafl, p53 and apoptosis (TUNEL assay). Compared to low levels of Bcl-x and Bcl-2 immunostaining in normal skin, all the squamoproliferative lesions had strong and diffuse KC expression of Bcl-x (>80%) but minimal to absent KC Bcl-2 expression (<15%). Bax immunopositivity was limited to the basal layer in normal skin and BD. In contrast, by examining serial sections both Bcl-x and Bax appeared to be coexpressed by the majority of malignant KCs in KA and SCC (>70%). These immunostaining profiles reveal that squamoproliferative lesions, including invasive transformed KCs, preferentially express Bcl-x over Bcl-2, in addition to upregulating their Bax levels. Even though there were numerous TUNEL positive cells in these squamoproliferative lesions, no other evidence of apoptosis was seen reinforcing the necessity to use caution when relying on TUNEL staining for identification of programmed cell death in skin biopsies. Normal sun-exposed skin had low but detectable p53 and rare p21wafl KC expression. Significantly higher numbers of p21wafl and p53 immunopositive KCs were noted throughout the lesions in BD and SCC in contrast to KA where p53 and rare p21wafl immunopositive KCs were primarily limited to the periphery of the tumor cell islands. In general, p53 KC expression was higher in all squamoproliferative lesions and sun-exposed normal skin compared to p21Wafl expression. Summary of the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins for both p21wafl and p53 KC expression was: SCC > BD > KA, in marked contrast to Ki-67 KC expression which was: BD > KA > SCC. The relatively few malignant cells in SCC that were actively participating in the cell cycle (i.e. Ki-67 positive) suggests that these neoplasms may arise primarily by increased cell survival and resistance to apoptosis rather than by hyperproliferation. These studies emphasize the importance of examining multiple members of protein families that regulate apoptosis, proliferation, growth arrest, and differentiation. It is the overall balance between these cellular phenomena that determine whether a cell remains viable or undergoes programmed cell death and contributes to the appearance of a neoplasm. The overexpression of Bcl-x may confer a survival advantage to malignant KCs unable to growth arrest to repair damaged DNA (mutant p53) and/or undergo terminal differentiation (increased p21wafl). Thus, mutation or aberrant expression of such proteins may participate in the multistep process of carcinogenesis that gives rise to these squamoproliferative lesions.
10625544	The regulative capacity of prespore amoebae as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and green fluorescent protein.	The ability of prespore Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae to undergo redifferentiation so as to reestablish normal spore/stalk proportioning has been demonstrated in various ways over the years, beginning with the classic microdissection work of K. Raper. The discovery of anterior-like cells in the slug posterior, however, cast doubt on that ability, and more recent experiments using a cell-specific toxin suggested that prespore redifferentiation may not in fact occur. To reexamine this question, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) upon amoebae expressing a mutated green fluorescent protein gene (S65T-GFP) under the control of a prespore-specific (PsA) promoter. FACS produced prespore cell populations with purities, measured by GFP expression, as high as 99. 5%. Sorted GFP(+) cells were developmentally competent and produced normally proportioned fruits, indistinguishable from those of "sham-sorted" (permissively gated, mixed GFP(+) and GFP(-)) amoebae. This result confirms the developmental totipotency of prespore amoebae.
11787793	Design and assembly of solid-phases for the effective recovery of nanoparticulate bioproducts in fluidised bed contactors.	Practical recovery of nanoparticulate bioproducts from suspension feedstocks has been studied in batch, fixed bed and fluidised bed adsorptive contactors. The performance of five discrete configurations of adsorbent solid phase has been critically evaluated in the anion exchange recovery of mg quantities of BSA nanoparticles. These have served as surrogate size mimics of less easily sourced viral and plasmid gene therapy vectors, characterised by high value and a shortage of supply in quantities sufficient for research and development. Performance parameters of binding capacity, efficacy of washing, desorption efficiency and total cycle time were strongly influenced by the external and internal topographies of solid phases, together with the localised concentrations of interacting chemical ligands which modulate adsorption. In respect of a full operational recovery cycle, porous adsorbents developed for refined chromatographic fractionation of macromolecules, appear less suited overall than solid, nonporous particles, or solid particles coated with a shallow pellicle of active adsorbent material. Such findings have been confirmed in a detailed demonstration of the recovery of plasmid DNA (7.8 Kb) from chemical lysates of Escherichia coli.
8263540	Ca2+ channel blockers attenuate beta-amyloid peptide toxicity to cortical neurons in culture.	Deposit of beta-amyloid protein (A beta) in Alzheimer's disease brain may contribute to the associated neurodegeneration. We have studied the neurotoxicity of A beta in primary cultures of murine cortical neurons, with the aim of identifying pharmacologic ways of attenuating the injury. Exposure of cultures to A beta (25-35 fragment; 3-25 microM) generally triggers slow, concentration-dependent neurodegeneration (over 24-72 h). With submaximal A beta-(25-35) exposure (10 microM), substantial (> 40% within 48 h) degeneration often occurs and is markedly attenuated by the presence of the Ca2+ channel blockers nimodipine (1-20 microM) and Co2+ (100 microM) during the A beta exposure. However, A beta neurotoxicity is not affected by the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists. We suggest that Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels may contribute to A beta-induced neuronal injury and that nimodipine and Co2+, by attenuating such influx, are able to attenuate A beta neurotoxicity.
9988706	Multiple functional Sp1 domains in the minimal promoter region of the neuronal nicotinic receptor alpha5 subunit gene.	The alpha5 subunit is a component of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are probably involved in the activation step of the catecholamine secretion process in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells. The promoter of the gene coding for this subunit was isolated, and its proximal region was characterized, revealing several GC boxes located close to the site of transcription initiation (from -111 to -40). Deletion analysis and transient transfections showed that a 266-base pair region (-111 to +155) gave rise to approximately 77 and 100% of the maximal transcriptional activity observed in chromaffin and SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of five different GC motifs indicated that all of them contribute to the activity of the alpha5 gene, but in a different way, depending on the type of transfected cell. Thus, in SHSY-5Y cells, alteration of the most promoter-proximal of the GC boxes decreased alpha5 promoter activity by approximately 50%, whereas single mutations of the other GC boxes had no effect. In chromaffin cells, by contrast, modification of any of the GC boxes produced a similar decrease in promoter activity (50-69%). In both cell types, however, activity was almost abolished when four GC boxes were suppressed simultaneously. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from either chromaffin or SHSY-5Y cells showed the specific binding of Sp1 protein to fragment -111 to -27. Binding of Sp1 to the GC boxes was also demonstrated by DNase I footprint analysis. This study suggests that the general transcription factor Sp1 plays a dominant role in alpha5 subunit expression, as has also been demonstrated previously for alpha3 and beta4 subunits. Since these three subunits have their genes tightly clustered and are expressed in chromaffin cells, probably as components of the same receptor subtype, we propose that Sp1 constitutes the key factor of a regulatory mechanism common to the three subunits.
12570104	Genetic polymorphisms associated with acute pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis.	Frequently an inherited predisposition to thrombosis remains clinically silent until an additional environmental factor intervenes. The present study aimed to assess distribution of inherited risk factors of venous thrombosis in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The prevalences of factor V Leiden (FV Leiden), prothrombin factor II G20210A (FII G20210A), C677T and A1298C of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutations were studied in 149 VTE patients and 100 controls. The following key risks were established: previous deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (23.5%), bed rest (34.2%), immobilisation of lower limb (10.1%), hospitalisation (30.9%) and obesity (28.9%). In 29 (19%) patients and in three (3%) controls FV Leiden was found. A significant association between VTE and FV Leiden was established. There were six (4%) carriers of the FII G20210A among VTE patients and one in the controls. No associations between VTE and MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T, A1298C) were found. In three of 149 patients both FV Leiden and FII G20210A polymorphisms were observed. The mean protein C activity was slightly, though nonsignificantly, smaller in VTE patients. In conclusion, there was a positive association between venous thromboembolism and factor V Leiden. Only a weak trend favouring a relationship between prothrombin factor II G20210A and venous thrombolism was present. No associations between common polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and venous thromboembolism were found.
10642882	The homeodomain: an ancient evolutionary motif in animals and plants.	The homeodomain is a DNA-binding motif within transcription factor proteins. These transcription factors may be involved in cell differentiation and control of cell growth, as well as patterning of diverse organisms. Given their strong evolutionary conservation, it has been suggested that homeodomain proteins have been fundamental to the evolution of animal species. We have previously shown that the major classes of animal homeodomains originated early in the evolution of metazoans. Here, I investigate the evolutionary relationships of homeodomain sequences in plants. Using distance matrix approaches with unweighted or weighted character state transitions, the overall results support the same conclusion: in plants, as in animals, multiple independent classes of divergent homeodomains can be distinguished, again suggesting an early evolutionary origin. These studies advance the hypothesis that the homeodomain represents a fundamental motif of gene regulation in multicellular organisms.
11906166	A role for the common GTP-binding protein in coupling of chromosome replication to cell growth and cell division.	Homologues of CgtA, the common GTP-binding protein of Vibrio harveyi, are present in diverse organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. In bacteria, proteins homologous to CgtA form a subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, called Obg/Gtp1. Similarity between bacterial members of this subfamily and their eukaryotic homologues is as high as about 50%. Nevertheless, specific functions of these proteins remain largely unknown. Genes coding for CgtA-like proteins are essential in almost all species of bacteria. The only known exception is V. harveyi, whose cells survive disruption of the cgtA gene. Therefore, the V. harveyi cgtA insertional mutant is a very useful tool for studies on functions of CgtA. Here we demonstrate that under normal growth conditions, cells of the cgtA mutant are slightly larger than wild-type cells, whereas indirect inhibition of DNA replication initiation by addition of rifampicin results in significantly higher differences in average cell size between these two strains as measured by flow cytometry. These differences decreased when cell division was inhibited by cephalexin. DNA synthesis per cell mass was found to be increased in the cgtA mutant relative to wild-type V. harveyi strain, whereas the mutant cells grew slower than bacteria with functional cgtA gene. Kinetics of DNA replication after inhibition of cell division was also considerably different in wild-type and cgtA mutant strains. These results suggest that the cgtA gene product plays a role in coupling of DNA replication to cell growth and cell division.
7903116	Role of a metabotropic glutamate receptor in synaptic modulation in the accessory olfactory bulb.	Various functions of glutamate transmission are mediated by both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) consists of at least six different subtypes that are classified into three subgroups, mGluR1/mGluR5, mGluR2/mGluR3, and mGluR4/mGluR6 (refs 1-5), but their physiological roles are largely unknown. Here we report the identification of a very potent agonist for mGluR2/mGluR3, DCG-IV, and the specific localization of mGluR2 in granule cell dendrites that form dendrodendritic synapses with mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb. Using the DCG-IV agonist for mGluR2 in combination with slice patch-recording, we demonstrate that the granule cell mGluR2 presynaptically suppresses inhibitory GABA (gamma-aminobutyrate) transmission to the mitral cell. Our results indicate that mGluR2 in granule cells plays an important role in the persistent excitation of olfactory sensory transmission in the accessory olfactory bulb by relieving mitral cells from the GABA inhibition.
11712394	[Chemical structure, active sites and receptor binding of insulin molecule and its signal transduction].	Biologically active insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, the A chain(21 amino acids) and the B chain(30 amino acids). Several regions of invariability closely related to the biological activity, such as (a) the position of cysteines that form the disulfide bridges, (b) the N- and C-terminal regions of the A-chain, and (c) hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus of the B chain. The functional insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric protein composed of two alpha and two beta subunits. The alpha subunits contain the insulin binding site and the binding causes conformational changes in the receptor molecule. The quaternary structure of the beta subunit then changes to allow for stimulating autophosphorylation of its tyrosine residues. Those in the catalytic domain(tyrosines 1146, 1150, 1151) are essential to promote the kinase activity of the receptor toward other protein substrates in insulin signalling system. The elucidation of detailed mechanisms of insulin binding to the receptor will be useful for the development of a novel hypoglycemic agent 'insulin receptor agonist', which directly acts on the insulin site and can be orally administered for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
8786986	Calculation of hydrolytic rate constants of poly(ortho ester)s from molecular weights determined by gel permeation chromatography.	PURPOSE: To obtained rate constants from weight-averaged (Mw) or z-averaged (Mz) molecular weights for polymers of Schule-Flory distribution and undergoing random scission. These constants were compared with those obtained by parallel 1HNMR studies. METHODS: The hydrolysis of two poly(ortho ester)s were followed by 1HNMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). RESULTS: Equations to convert number-averaged (Mn), Mw and Mz into fraction of backbone remaining (fc) were derived. First-order hydrolytic rate constants of two poly(ortho ester)s; DETOSU-HD and DETOSU-CDM were calculated using these relationships. The rate constants calculated from 1HNMR, Mz and Mw were 0.215, 0.21 and 0.182 hr-1, respectively, for DETOSU-CDM and 0.152, 0.086 and 0.038 hr-1 for DETOSU-HD. The large discrepancy in the rates determined by 1HNMR and GPC in the latter case was attributed to that the detector response (refractive index) of the monomers was lower than that of the high molecular weight polymer. The difference is small in the case of DETOSU-CDM, and the rates calculated from GPC data were comparable or nearly identical to that obtained from 1HNMR data. CONCLUSIONS: Although GPC can yield rapid and valuable kinetic data for the degradation of biodegradable polymers, the system, however, must be carefully calibrated to account for the variations in Mark-Houwink coefficients and in the response of the mass detector between the high and low MW polymers.
12525615	Overlapping motifs (PTAP and PPEY) within the Ebola virus VP40 protein function independently as late budding domains: involvement of host proteins TSG101 and VPS-4.	The VP40 protein of Ebola virus can bud from mammalian cells in the form of lipid-bound, virus-like particles (VLPs), and late budding domains (L-domains) are conserved motifs (PTAP, PPxY, or YxxL; where "x" is any amino acid) that facilitate the budding of VP40-containing VLPs. VP40 is unique in that potential overlapping L-domains with the sequences PTAP and PPEY are present at amino acids 7 to 13 of VP40 (PTAPPEY). L-domains are thought to function by interacting with specific cellular proteins, such as the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, and a component of the vacuolar protein sorting (vps) pathway, tsg101. Mutational analysis of the PTAPPEY sequence of VP40 was performed to understand further the contribution of each individual motif in promoting VP40 budding. In addition, the contribution of tsg101 and a second member of the vps pathway, vps4, in facilitating budding was addressed. Our results indicate that (i) both the PTAP and PPEY motifs contribute to efficient budding of VP40-containing VLPs; (ii) PTAP and PPEY can function as L-domains when separated and moved from the N terminus (amino acid position 7) to the C terminus (amino acid position 316) of full-length VP40; (iii) A VP40-PTAP/tsg101 interaction recruits tsg101 into budding VLPs; (iv) a VP40-PTAP/tsg101 interaction recruits VP40 into lipid raft microdomains; and (v) a dominant-negative mutant of vps4 (E228Q), but not wild-type vps4, significantly inhibited the budding of Ebola virus (Zaire). These results provide important insights into the complex interplay between viral and host proteins during the late stages of Ebola virus budding.
11853545	Phosphorylation of Xenopus transcription factor IIIA by an oocyte protein kinase CK2.	Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), isolated from the cytoplasmic 7 S ribonucleoprotein complex of Xenopus oocytes, is phosphorylated when incubated with [gamma-(32)P]ATP. This modification is due to a trace kinase activity that remains associated with the factor through several steps of purification. The kinase can use either ATP or GTP, and will phosphorylate casein and phosvitin to the exclusion of TFIIIA. The kinase is reactive with a ten-amino-acid peptide that is a specific substrate for protein kinase CK2 (CK2; formerly casein kinase II). In addition, inhibition of phosphorylation by heparin and stimulation by spermidine indicate that the activity can be ascribed to CK2. Phospho amino acid analysis established that serine is the sole phosphoryl acceptor in TFIIIA. There are four consensus sites for CK2 in TFIIIA; all contain serine residues at the putative site of phosphorylation. TFIIIA immunoprecipitated from oocytes, which were incubated with [(32)P]orthophosphate, is also phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues. Only the cyanogen bromide fragment, which was derived from the N-terminal end of TFIIIA, is labelled in vivo. A recognition sequence for CK2, located at Ser(16) in the beta-turn of the first zinc-finger domain, is the only protein kinase consensus sequence present in this peptide. Assays in vitro with site-specific mutants of TFIIIA established that Ser(16) is the preferred site of phosphorylation, with some secondary modification at Ser(314).
12637547	Ets-2 and components of mammalian SWI/SNF form a repressor complex that negatively regulates the BRCA1 promoter.	Ets-2 is a transcriptional activator that can be modulated by ras-dependent phosphorylation. Evidence is presented indicating that ets-2 can also act as a transcriptional repressor. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, exogenous ets-2 repressed the activity of a BRCA1 promoter-luciferase reporter dependent on a conserved ets-2-binding site in this promoter. Conditional overproduction of ets-2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in repression of endogenous BRCA1 mRNA expression. To address the mechanism by which ets-2 could act as a repressor, a biochemical approach was used to identify proteins that interacted with the ets-2 pointed domain. From this analysis, components of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex were found to interact with ets-2. Brg-1, the ATP-hydrolyzing component of the SWI/SNF complex, along with the BAF57/p50 and Ini1 subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated from cells with ets-2. The pointed domain of ets-2 directly interacted in vitro with the C-terminal region of Brg-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The combination of Brg-1 and ets-2 could repress the BRCA1 promoter reporter in transfection assays. These results support a role for ets-2 as a repressor and indicate that components of the mammalian SNF/SWI complex are required as co-repressors.
12435361	Mouse GLI3 regulates Fgf8 expression and apoptosis in the developing neural tube, face, and limb bud.	The zinc finger transcription factor GLI3 is considered a repressor of vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. In humans, the absence of GLI3 function causes Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, affecting the development of the brain, eye, face, and limb. Because the etiology of these malformations is not well understood, we examined the phenotype of mouse Gli3-/- mutants as a model to investigate this. We observed an up-regulation of Fgf8 in the anterior neural ridge, isthmus, eye, facial primordia, and limb buds of mutant embryos, sites coinciding with the human disease. Intriguingly, endogenous apoptosis was reduced in Fgf8-positive areas in Gli3-/- mutants. Since SHH is thought to be involved in Fgf8 regulation, we compared Fgf8 expression in Shh-/- and Gli3-/-;Shh-/- mutant embryos. Whereas Fgf8 expression was almost absent in Shh-/- mutants, it was up-regulated in Gli3-/-;Shh-/- double mutants, suggesting that SHH is not required for Fgf8 induction, and that GLI3 normally represses Fgf8 independently of SHH. In the limb bud, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of Gremlin in Gli3-/- mutants might contribute to a decrease in apoptosis. Together, our data reveal that GLI3 limits Fgf8-expression domains in multiple tissues, through a mechanism that may include the induction or maintenance of apoptosis.
10880723	H-ras and Nm23-H1 gene expression and proteolytic activity in squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.	BACKGROUND: The invasive and metastatic potential of malignant cells results from complex interactions of numerous factors not yet fully understood. Genomic alterations such as ras overexpression and nm23-H1 inhibition have been found to be frequently associated with increased invasiveness in various cancers. On the other hand, secretion of different proteinases are necessary for malignant cells to traverse a network of matrix macromolecules, but the relationship between the genomic alterations and the proteolytic phenotype is still unclear. Our aim was to investigate whether the appearance of the proteolytic phenotype had any correlation with the expression of H-ras and nm23-H1 genes in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. METHODS: Twenty-five samples from patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix at different clinical stages were studied. Cathepsin B1, plasminogen activator, and collagenase activity were assessed in tissue cytosols using specific synthetic oligopeptides as substrates. The expression of H-ras and nm23-H1 was investigated by means of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Our results showed that cathepsin B1 was the most consistently elevated proteinase, demonstrating a linear correlation with clinical staging. H-ras expression was found elevated in 40% of the cases. Nm23-H1 protein immunoreactivity was positive in 40% of the cases. No correlation was found among H-ras, cathepsin B1 activity, and survival rate. Among cases with high cysteine proteinase activity, a different clinical behavior depending on the expression of Nm23-H1 was observed. The cases with Nm23-H1 protein had a markedly better survival rate than those lacking this protein. In contrast, the absence of Nm23-H1 in association with high cathepsin B1 activity was a clear indicator of a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a complex interaction between the proteolytic phenotype and the expression of H-ras and nm23-H1 genes in carcinoma of the cervix that influences the clinical behavior of the tumor.
11385508	The morphogen Sonic hedgehog is an indirect angiogenic agent upregulating two families of angiogenic growth factors.	Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a prototypical morphogen known to regulate epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during embryonic development. We found that the hedgehog-signaling pathway is present in adult cardiovascular tissues and can be activated in vivo. Shh was able to induce robust angiogenesis, characterized by distinct large-diameter vessels. Shh also augmented blood-flow recovery and limb salvage following operatively induced hind-limb ischemia in aged mice. In vitro, Shh had no effect on endothelial-cell migration or proliferation; instead, it induced expression of two families of angiogenic cytokines, including all three vascular endothelial growth factor-1 isoforms and angiopoietins-1 and -2 from interstitial mesenchymal cells. These findings reveal a novel role for Shh as an indirect angiogenic factor regulating expression of multiple angiogenic cytokines and indicate that Shh might have potential therapeutic use for ischemic disorders.
9483177	Pentastarch instead of albumin as replacement fluid for therapeutic plasma exchange. The Canadian Apheresis Group.	BACKGROUND: Human albumin is commonly used as a replacement fluid in therapeutic plasma exchange (PE). In order to determine whether Pentaspan (PES), a synthetic low molecular weight starch solution, might be an effective substitute, we compared albumin with PES in 12 patients with myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Six patients were randomly assigned to receive PES and six to receive albumin as replacement fluid during their course of PE, which consisted of two to five treatments delivered over a maximum of 10 days. All patients were hospitalized and observed closely. Blood pressures were recorded every 4 hours and daily measurements were made of hematologic, coagulation, and immunoglobulin parameters. RESULTS: Individual exchange volumes were similar in each group (37 ml/kg--range 6-62--in patients receiving albumin vs. 41 ml/kg--range 6-41--in those receiving PES). Changes in immunoglobulin levels and coagulation parameters were similar but mild, transient thrombocytopenia was observed in three subjects given PES. Total serum protein and albumin levels decreased significantly in patients replaced with PES. Clinically, PES was well tolerated. Hypotension occurred in one patient who developed septic shock due to an infected femoral catheter; in another patient, a pre-existing pleural effusion was thought to increase slightly. CONCLUSIONS: PES appears to be a safe replacement fluid for PE, but larger clinical studies are required to confirm these findings.
10674823	Loss of heterozygosity of adenomatous polyposis coli gene in cutaneous tumors as determined by using polymerase chain reaction and paraffin section preparations.	It has been suggested that an alteration in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene, is one of the earlier events in carcinogenesis of some adenocarcinomas. We undertook this study to determine the prevalence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the APC gene in several kinds of cutaneous tumors. Fifty-seven unrelated Japanese patients were examined for analysis of the APC gene. The 57 cases consisted of extramammary Paget's disease, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), eccrine poroma and porocarcinoma, metastatic tumor of rectal adenocarcinoma and malignant melanoma. DNA was extracted from the tumor and normal portions dissected from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding sections and amplified with the use of the PCR. The amplified DNA was examined for LOH in the APC gene. Seven samples of 32 heterozygous persons of APC gene (three out of seven eccrine poromas, two eccrine porocarcinomas and two metastatic tumors of rectal adenocarcinoma) showed for LOH in the APC gene. None of the heterozygous samples from the extramammary Paget's disease (11), SCC (five) and melanoma (five) showed LOH. These results suggest that tumor or tumor suppressor genes, other than the APC gene, may be responsible for extramammary Paget's disease and SCC and that LOH involving APC may have some relevance to the formation and progression of eccrine tumors as in rectal tumors.
9000511	Casein kinase II phosphorylates Ser468 in the PEST domain of the Drosophila IkappaB homologue cactus.	Cactus protein is a Drosophila homologue of the mammalian IkappaB family of cytoplasmic anchor proteins. In unstimulated cells they function to retain rel/NFkappaB transcription factors in the cytoplasm but are rapidly degraded in response to signalling. The destruction of cactus or IkappaBalpha allows the rel/NFkappaB transcription factor to relocalise to the nucleus. Cactus is a phosphoprotein and has in its C-terminus a PEST protein stability domain. In this paper we show that, like mammalian IkappaBalpha, the PEST domain of cactus is phosphorylated by casein kinase II. We have localised the site of modification to a single residue, Ser468, and find no evidence for additional phosphorylation sites. The conservation of these sites in mammalian and invertebrate cytoplasmic anchor proteins suggests that phosphorylation by casein kinase II may play a critical functional role, plausibly in the regulation of constitutive or inducible proteolysis.
9852692	[The inhibition of lidocaine metabolism by various barbiturates in rat hepatic microsome].	To evaluate the effects of various barbiturates on lidocaine metabolism by cytochrome P-450 (P-450), enzyme kinetics were analyzed in an in vitro study using rat hepatic microsomes. Phenobarbital, amobarbital, hexobarbital, pentobarbital, and thiamylal showed the mixed type inhibition of lidocaine metabolism with inhibition constants being 4.89, 1.08, 2.76, 0.77 and 0.65 mM, respectively. Same as lidocaine, all barbiturates used in the present study, corresponding to binding with P-450, induced the I type of spectral change of P-450. Since these did not affect cytochrome C reductase activity, it was suggested that this inhibition of lidocaine metabolism in hepatic microsomes may have been caused by the reduction of activity on P-450 by the barbiturates.
9334212	The role of mGrb10alpha in insulin-like growth factor I-mediated growth.	Several isoforms of Grb10 are known to interact with either the insulin receptor or the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor, or both. Inasmuch as the data in the literature on the function of Grb10 are not always concordant, we have investigated the role of one of these isoforms, mGrb10alpha, in cell proliferation. For this purpose, a plasmid expressing mGrb10alpha was stably transfected into p6 cells and other mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines. An overexpressed mGrb10alpha inhibits IGF-I-mediated growth, causes a delay in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and partially reverses the transformed phenotype. In contrast, it has no effect on insulin stimulation of cell proliferation. These studies indicate that this isoform of Grb10 has an inhibitory effect on IGF-I signaling of cell proliferation.
7734302	Colorectal carcinomas show frequent allelic loss on the long arm of chromosome 17 with evidence for a specific target region.	Allelic loss is a common mechanism of inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes in colorectal carcinomas. A number of known or putative tumour-suppressor genes including NF1, BRCA1, NME1, NME2 and prohibitin are present on the long arm of chromosome 17, and this region has not been extensively analysed in colorectal tumours. In this study 72 colorectal carcinomas were examined for allelic loss at eight loci on chromosome 17. Allelic loss was frequent both at the p53 locus, which is known to be important in colorectal carcinoma, and also telomeric to p53 on 17p. Allelic loss continued to be present in more than 50% of cases in the pericentromeric region and on proximal 17q to the marker LEW101 (D17S40) at 17q22-23. The most telomeric markers on 17q showed lower rates of allelic loss. Analysis of cases with partial deletions which did not include the p53 locus showed a common region of overlap of the deletions centred on D17S40. This suggests the target of allelic loss on 17q is a tumour-suppressor gene in this region.
9225051	Transfer of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi retention signals to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp160 inhibits intracellular transport and proteolytic processing of viral glycoprotein but does not influence the cellular site of virus particle budding.	In this study, specific signals known to mediate endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi localization of transmembrane proteins have been transferred to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env gene product. The intracellularly retained recombinant glycoproteins were not proteolytically processed to gp120 and gp41, which is further evidence that this process occurs at a later stage in the transport pathway, presumably within or near the trans-Golgi network. Since the subcellular localization of the viral glycoproteins of enveloped viruses can be one of the factors determining the cellular site of particle assembly and release, experiments were performed to determine if this property was altered by coexpression of the recombinant HIV-1 glycoproteins. When wild-type virus was compared to mutant virus encoding the intracellularly retained glycoproteins, the extent of HIV-1 particle release into the extracellular medium remained unaffected, and electron-microscopic analysis did not reveal any significant alteration in the cellular sites of particle assembly and budding. Thus, in COS-7 cells, altered subcellular localization of the viral glycoprotein does not exert a dominant influence on the assembly site of the HIV-1 particle.
11395394	Amyloid angiopathy and variability in amyloid beta deposition is determined by mutation position in presenilin-1-linked Alzheimer's disease.	The presenilins (PSs) are components of large molecular complexes that contain beta-catenin and function as gamma-secretase. We report here a striking correlation between amyloid angiopathy and the location of mutation in PS-1 linked Alzheimer's disease. The amount of amyloid beta protein, Abeta(42(43)), but not Abeta(40,) deposited in the frontal cortex of the brain is increased in 54 cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, encompassing 25 mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene, compared to sporadic Alzheimer's disease. The amount of Abeta(40) in PS-1 Alzheimer's disease varied according to the copy number of epsilon4 alleles of the Apolipoprotein E gene. Although the amounts of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42(43)) deposited did not correlate with the genetic location of the mutation in a strict linear sense, the histological profile did so vary. Cases with mutations between codon 1 and 200 showed, in frontal cortex, many diffuse plaques, few cored plaques, and mild or moderate amyloid angiopathy. Cases with mutations occurring after codon 200 also showed many diffuse plaques, but the number and size of cored plaques were increased (even when epsilon4 allele was not present) and these were often clustered around blood vessels severely affected by amyloid angiopathy. Similarly, diverging histological profiles, mainly according to the degree of amyloid angiopathy, were seen in the cerebellum. Mutations in the PS-1 gene may therefore alter the topology of the PS-1 protein so as to favor Abeta formation and deposition, generally, but also to facilitate amyloid angiopathy particularly in cases in which the mutation lies beyond codon 200. Finally we report that the amount of Abeta(42(43)) deposited in the brain correlated with the amount of this produced in culture by cells bearing the equivalent mutations.
8952521	Antibodies to presenilin proteins detect neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.	Mutations in the presenilin (PS)-1 and PS-2 genes have been shown to be linked with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined Alzheimer's brain tissue by immunohistochemistry using a set of antibodies raised to sequences shared between PS-1 and PS-2 proteins. These antibodies reacted exclusively with a subset of neurofibrillary tangles and not with neuropil threads or dystrophic neurites. Detection of the presenilin epitope in neurofibrillary tangles was observed in sporadic Alzheimer's disease brain samples and in samples from individuals carrying PS-1 and PS-2 mutations with no qualitative difference. These data indicate that both wild-type and mutant PS proteins are involved in a common pathogenic pathway in AD.
8712689	Molecular genetics of malignant insulinoma.	Malignant insulinoma is an rare form of cancer with poor prognosis and a reported 5-year survival of 35%. Relatively little is known about the etiology of this disease or of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that participate in its genesis and progression. To address this issue, several protooncogenes, including K-ras, N-ras, erbB-2, erbB-3,c-myc, c-fos, c-jun were examined. Also analyzed was the expression of the growth factors TGF-alpha, EGF, and insulin as well as the EGF receptor (EGF-R), p53 and the putative anti-metastasis gene nm23-H1. These were examined in malignant insulinomas, benign insulinomas, pancreatic B cell hyperplasias and in normal endocrine pancreas. Normal endocrine pancreas showed moderate immunoreaction for c-myc and a strong reaction for insulin. All other parameters were negative. Benign pancreatic B cell hyperplasias were slightly or moderately positive for N-ras and TGF-alpha, and were weakly positive for EGF-R. They were strongly positive for c-myc and insulin. In malignant insulinomas there was strong immunoreaction for c-myc, TGF-alpha, N-ras, K-ras and p53. Insulin reaction was moderate or strong. Molecular genetic studies have been performed for the presence of activating point mutations in codon 12 of the c-K-ras oncogene. Mutations were detected using primer-mediated, mutant-enriched, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and were further characterized by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Four out of six patients with malignant insulinoma and two out of eight patients with benign insulinoma harbored K-ras point mutations at codon 12. All patients with mutated K-ras oncogene also had elevated levels of p53 protein as well as c-myc and TGF-alpha. In one extremely malignant case we found concomitant mutation at codon 12 of K-ras and codon 61 of the N-ras gene. Our data are consistent with the idea that malignant progression is accompanied by the progressive accumulation of multiple genetic lesions and suggest that activation of myc, TGF-alpha and ras genes may be early events in the development of insulinoma.
7565779	Role of EGR-1 in thapsigargin-inducible apoptosis in the melanoma cell line A375-C6.	Induction of apoptosis by diverse exogenous signals is dependent on elevation of intracellular Ca2+. This process of cell death can be blocked by actinomycin D, indicating that it requires gene transcription events. To identify genes that are required for apoptosis, we used thapsigargin (TG), which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum-dependent Ca(2+)-ATPase and thereby increases cytosolic Ca2+. Exposure to TG led to induction of the zinc finger transcription factor, EGR-1, and apoptosis in human melanoma cells, A375-C6. To determine the functional relevance of EGR-1 expression in TG-inducible apoptosis, we employed a dominant negative mutant which functionally competes with EGR-1 in these cells. Interestingly, the dominant negative mutant inhibited TG-inducible apoptosis. Consistent with this observation, an antisense oligomer directed against Egr-1 also led to a diminution of the number of cells that undergo TG-inducible apoptosis. These results suggest a novel regulatory role for EGR-1 in mediating apoptosis that is induced by intracellular Ca2+ elevation. We have previously shown that in these melanoma cells, EGR-1 acts to inhibit the growth arresting action of interleukin-1. Together, these results imply that EGR-1 plays inducer-specific roles in growth control.
9511178	Polymorphism of the Pi class glutathione S-transferase in normal populations and cancer patients.	Deficiencies of the glutathione transferase isoenzymes GSTM1-1 and GSTT1-1 have been shown to be risk modifiers in a number of different cancers but there have been no similar studies with GSTP1-1, the only member of the Pi class of glutathione S-transferases expressed in humans. Over-expression of GSTP1-1 in tumours suggests that it may be a significant factor in acquired resistance to certain anticancer drugs. We previously identified a cDNA clone with two amino acid substitutions (I105V, A114V). This clone suggests that the GSTP1 gene is polymorphic and it is possible that the different genotypes may be associated with altered cancer risk or drug resistance. In the present study, we report methods for genotyping individuals at codons 105 and 114 of GSTP1 and demonstrate that these two loci are polymorphic in several different racial groups. We also detected significant linkage disequilibrium between these two loci. To determine if either of the alleles at these two loci were associated with altered cancer susceptibility, we genotyped individuals with colorectal cancer or lung cancer. A total of 131 colorectal and 184 lung cancer patients were compared with 199 control individuals. Overall, there were no significant associations between the GSTP1 polymorphisms and either form of cancer.
8174632	PMA inhibits the growth of human fibroblasts after the induction of immediate-early genes.	WS-1 cells, human fibroblasts derived from embryonic skin, become quiescent in serum-free medium. Addition of serum or thrombin stimulates incorporation of 3H-labeled thymidine 16-40 h later. The tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited this response in quiescent cells stimulated with serum or thrombin. PMA also inhibited thymidine incorporation in rapidly growing WS-1 cells. Since the inhibition caused by PMA could result from activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or the down-regulation of PKC, the effect of the PKC inhibitor, GF 109203X, was tested. GF 109203X did not affect thymidine incorporation induced by serum. GF 109203X prevented the inhibition caused by PMA, suggesting that the activation of PKC is required for the inhibition of DNA synthesis. A prolonged activation of PKC is probably required, since a single treatment of a synthetic diacylglycerol does not inhibit and addition of GF 109203X 2 to 8 h after PMA reverses the inhibition. One possible target for PMA activity is the induction of immediate-early response genes. Thrombin or serum treatment of quiescent WS-1 cells induced protooncogenes c-fos and c-jun. PMA also induced c-fos and c-jun with a time course similar to that of serum or thrombin. The induction of c-fos by PMA was sensitive to staurosporine or GF 109203X. A time course of PMA addition indicated that maximal inhibition of DNA synthesis occurred when PMA was added 4 h after stimulation with serum. These results suggest that the PMA-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis occurs through an activation of PKC that inhibits DNA synthesis at a point after the induction of c-fos and c-jun.
9470136	Apolipoprotein E gene in Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer's disease.	Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) epsilon 4 allele is a risk factor for early and late onset Alzheimer's disease. This prompted us to examine other neurophyschiatric phenotypes. Epsilon 4 allele was significantly enriched in Lewy body dementia (n = 39) but not in Parkinson's disease (n = 50) or Schizophrenia (n = 175) compared to aged non-demented controls (n = 47) and the Scottish population (n = 400). We conclude that Lewy body disease should be regarded as a variant of Alzheimer's but not Parkinson's disease.
11770276	[Torsion of the accessory spleen: an atypical etiology for acute abdomen].	The accessory spleen is often a incidental discovery. The accessory post-accidental spleen are unusual. The torsion of a movable spleen is possible and represent about 0.2 to 0.3% of splenectomy. But the torsion of an accessory spleen is exceptional. A case of acute torsion of an accessory spleen is reported. In a 26-year-old women was admitted with acute abdominal pain. The abdominal ultrasound and the abdominal X-Ray are no specific. In the face of the acute pain, a laparoscopy was necessary. At laparoscopy, the patient was found to have torsion and infarction of an accessory spleen in the pelvis. The treatment was a splenectomy and the evolution was favorable.
11008591	Prevalence of Huntington disease in New South Wales in 1996.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Huntington disease (HD) in New South Wales on Australian Census Day (6 August) 1996. DESIGN: Survey of records of the Huntington Disease Service and major hospitals, and of neurologists, psychiatrists, clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: All patients in NSW who, on Census Day 1996, either had a definite diagnosis of HD (motor signs of chorea or ataxia and family history of HD or positive DNA test result) or would have had signs and later received a definite diagnosis (assessed 1 April 1997 to 1 July 1999). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence (HD patients per 100,000 population); patient characteristics; year and basis of diagnosis. RESULTS: 380 patients with definite HD were identified, giving a prevalence of HD in NSW in 1996 of 6.29 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 5.68-6.96). A third of HD patients were aged 60 years or older. Diagnosis was confirmed by DNA testing for 171 patients (45%), including 30 (8%) with no recorded family history. Average numbers of new diagnoses per year were 11.8 (1984-1988), 21.8 (1989-1993) and 28.6 (1994-1998). Estimated number of people with a 50% risk of inheriting the HD mutation was 25.2 per 100,000 population. Estimated incidence of HD in 1996 was 0.65 per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of HD in NSW is similar to estimated prevalence in other Australian and Western populations. Increasing numbers of cases are being diagnosed, and the 18 chronic care beds currently designated for HD patients in NSW are unlikely to be sufficient.
10868777	Autism associated with the mitochondrial DNA G8363A transfer RNA(Lys) mutation.	We report a family with a heterogeneous group of neurologic disorders associated with the mitochondrial DNA G8363A transfer ribonucleic acid (RNA)Lys mutation. The phenotype of one child in the family was consistent with autism. During his second year of life, he lost previously acquired language skills and developed marked hyperactivity with toe-walking, abnormal reciprocal social interaction, stereotyped mannerisms, restricted interests, self-injurious behavior, and seizures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and repeated serum lactate studies were normal. His older sister developed signs of Leigh syndrome with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, seizures, and cognitive regression. Her laboratory studies revealed increased MRI T2-weighted signal in the putamen and posterior medulla, elevated lactate in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and absence of cytochrome c oxidase staining in muscle histochemistry. Molecular analysis in her revealed the G8363A mutation of the mitochondrial transfer RNA(Lys) gene in blood (82% mutant mitochondrial DNA) and muscle (86%). The proportions of mutant mitochondrial DNA from her brother with autism were lower (blood 60%, muscle 61%). It is likely that the origin of his autism phenotype is the pathogenic G8363A mitochondrial DNA mutation. This observation suggests that certain mitochondrial point mutations could be the basis for autism in some individuals.
7608738	Abnormal brain and muscle energy metabolism shown by 31P-MRS in familial hemiplegic migraine.	Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of unknown pathogenesis characterized by migraine and transitory hemiplegic attacks. We describe a kindred fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for FHM in which: (1) brain phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) showed a reduced phosphocreatine content accompanied by high [ADP], high percentage of V/Vmax of ATP biosynthesis and decreased phosphorylation potential; (2) muscle 31P-MRS showed a reduced rate of phosphocreatine recovery after exercise; (3) blood lactate was increased after effort; (4) muscle biopsy showed, in one patient, rare ragged red fibers succinate-dehydrogenase positive and cytochrome c oxidase negative; (5) genetic analysis of muscle mitochondrial DNA did not show any of the two point mutations in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) associated with the MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes). The defective energy metabolism of brain and muscle found in this pedigree suggests a multisystemic disorder of mitochondrial function in this FHM pedigree.
10388472	BRCA1 gene mutations in sporadic ovarian carcinomas: detection by PCR and reverse allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization.	BACKGROUND: Although germline mutations in BRCA1 play a central role in familial breast and ovarian cancers, to date, no somatic mutations in BRCA1 have been reported in sporadic breast cancer, and only five somatic mutations have been identified in the sporadic ovarian carcinomas. Because loss of heterozygosity appears frequently at the BRCA1 locus in nonfamilial breast and ovarian carcinomas, we searched for mutations in the BRCA1 gene in sporadic ovarian tumors. METHODS: We developed a detection system based on PCR and reverse allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization on membrane strips for the simultaneous detection of 17 frequently occurring mutations in the BRCA1 gene. RESULTS: As little as 2% mutant DNA in a sample could be detected. Two of 122 DNA samples isolated from sporadic ovarian tumor biopsies contained the Cys61Gly mutation. Both mutations were germline mutations. One of these was an ovarian metastasis of a primary fallopian tube carcinoma. The tubal carcinoma was also confirmed to contain the Cys61Gly mutation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that a germline BRCA1 mutation is associated with primary tubal carcinoma. The 17 specific mutations in the BRCA1 gene do not play a major role in the tumorigenesis and progression of sporadic ovarian cancer.
11121865	Improvement of gene transfer to cervical cancer cell lines using non-viral agents.	Virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of recombinant capsid protein L1 and L2 of human papillomavirus type 16 were conjugated with polylysine (PL) and gene transfer was performed using VLP-PL conjugates to allow the expression of targeted gene. When HeLa cells were incubated with VLP-PL conjugate coupled with plasmid cytomegalovirus beta-galactosidase (pCMVbeta-gal), about 10% of cells were transfected and demonstrated beta-galactosidase activity. Hence chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was also expressed significantly in VLP-PL-plasmid simian virus 2 chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (pSV2CAT)-transfected cells, VLP-PL conjugate was tested whether it could transfer a tumor suppressor gene, pCMVp53, to HeLa cells and the exogenously provided p53 gene complexed to VLP-PL conjugate was detected from HeLa cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Interestingly, additional increase of transfection efficiency was demonstrated in the presence of poloxamer 407 when C-33A cells were transfected with VLP-PL-pCMVbeta-gal complex. The result support the notion that VLP-PL conjugate may be a promising vector to transfer genetic materials into cancer cells and poloxamer 407 can be used for enhancing the transfection efficiency of VLP-PL conjugate.
12673079	It is true that, when Langerhans cells migrate from the skin to the lymph node, they are transported via lymph vessels.	BACKGROUND: Generally, Langerhans cells deliver antigen information from the skin to the draining lymph nodes via lymph vessels. METHODS: By immunohistopathology, we investigated the delivery route of Langerhans cells in human skin using CD1a and S-100 protein antibodies. RESULTS: We noted CD1a- and S-100-positive Langerhans cells in the lymph vessels of the dermis. These were shaped like dendritic cells and presented with some lymphocytes, melanophages, melanin granules and lymph in the same vessels. CONCLUSION: These observations support the concept that Langerhans cells deliver antigen peptides to regional lymph nodes via afferent lymph vessels.
10201754	Improved nerve regeneration with neutralization of transforming growth factor-beta1.	OBJECTIVES: Recovery of injured peripheral nerves depends on a balance between Schwann cell regeneration and scar formation. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) has been implicated as a humoral stimulus in scar formation. The neutralization of TGF-beta1 has been beneficial in the reduction of fibrosis. This study was to identify the presence of TGF-beta1 in regenerating peripheral nerve and to measure motor nerve regeneration by the neutralization of TGF-beta1 in neural wounds. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized study of rat sciatic nerve regeneration. METHOD: Sciatic nerve axotomy was performed, followed by serial immunohistochemical staining by anti-TGF-beta1 at 12 to 216 hours (n = 5). Two groups (n = 10) with sciatic axotomy and epineural repair were treated with a 7-day perineural administration of neutralizing antibody of TGF-beta1 or saline carrier via subcutaneous silicone infusion port. A control group (n = 10) without axotomy with anti-TGF-beta1 administration was established. At 12 weeks the compound muscle action potential amplitude (CMAP) and the muscle twitch strength generated by the gastrocnemiussoleus muscle complex were measured. RESULTS: TGF-beta1 was qualitatively present with maximal concentration by 72 to 144 hours. CMAP amplitude in the anti-TGF-beta1/axotomy group was 49.6% of the control and the axotomy/saline group was 31% of the control. Muscle twitch strength was 74% and 46.5%, respectively. These differences were statistically significant, P = .05. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of TGF-beta1 at regenerating nerve sites was confirmed. The benefit of neutralization of transforming growth factor on CMAP and muscle twitch strength was shown. These results suggest improved regeneration at nerve injury sites with neutralization of TGF-beta1.
10327065	Differential involvement of the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) receptor/ligand system on apoptosis induced by the wild-type p53 gene transfer in human cancer cells.	The CD95 (Fas/APO-1) system regulates a number of physiological and pathological processes of cell death. The ligand for CD95 induces apoptosis in sensitive target cells by interacting with a transmembrane cell surface CD95 receptor. We previously reported that the recombinant adenovirus-mediated transfer of the wild-type p53 gene caused apoptotic cell death in a variety of human cancer cells. To better understand the mechanism responsible for this cell death signaling, we have investigated the potential involvement of the CD95 receptor/ligand system in p53-mediated apoptosis. The transient expression of the wild-type p53 gene upregulated the CD95 ligand mRNA as well as protein expression in H1299 human lung cancer cells deficient for p53 and in DLD-1 and SW620 human colon cancer cells with mutated p53, all of which constitutively expressed CD95 receptor as shown by a flow cytometric analysis, and induced rapid apoptotic cell death as early as 24 h after gene transfer. However, the sensitivity to the cytolytic effect of agonistic anti-CD95 antibody (CH11) varied among these cell lines: CH11 induced apoptosis in H1299 cells, but not in DLD-1 and SW620 cells despite their abundant CD95 receptor expression, suggesting that the CD95 receptors on DLD-1 and SW620 cells might be inactivated. In addition, an antagonistic anti-CD95 ligand antibody (4H9) that interfered with the CD95-receptor-ligand interaction partially reduced the apoptosis induced by the wild-type p53 gene transfer in H1299 cells, whereas apoptosis of DLD-1 and SW620 cells occurred in the presence of 4H9. Taken together, these findings led us to conclude that the CD95 receptor/ligand system is differentially involved in p53-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the restoration of the wild-type p53 function may mediate apoptosis through CD95 receptor/ligand interactions as well as an alternative pathway.
11388666	E2F-1 induced apoptosis.	Members of the E2F family of transcription factors play an important role in regulating the cell cycle, and their activity is often perturbed during the development of human malignancies. More recent work has shown that E2F-1 regulates apoptosis as well as proliferation, in part by stabilizing the p53 tumor suppressor, an important mediator of apoptosis. This has led to the suggestion that E2F-1 may function as a tumor surveillance mechanism, detecting aberrant proliferation and engaging apoptotic pathways to protect the organism from developing tumors.
11259393	Increased DNA alterations in atherosclerotic lesions of individuals lacking the GSTM1 genotype.	Reduced glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role as an intracellular defense system providing detoxification of a broad spectrum of reactive species and their excretion as water-soluble conjugates. Conjugation of GSH with electrophiles is catalyzed by GSH S-transferases (GST), which constitute a broad family of phase II isoenzymes. Two of the GST encoding genes, GSTM1 (mu) and GSTT1 (theta), have a null genotype due to their homozygous deletion that results in lack of active protein. Polymorphisms within GSTT1 and especially GSTM1 have often been associated with cancer in various organs as well as with elevated levels of DNA adducts in various cell types. We recently demonstrated that DNA adducts are consistently detectable in smooth muscle cells (SMC) of human abdominal aorta affected by atherosclerotic lesions. Here we provide evidence that levels of adducts to SMC DNA from atherosclerotic lesions are consistently increased in individuals having the null GSTM1 genotype, whereas no association was established with the GSTT1 polymorphism. The influence of GSTM1 deletion was better expressed in never-smokers and ex-smokers than in current smokers. These findings bear relevance to the epidemiology of atherosclerosis and suggest that metabolic polymorphisms may contribute to the interindividual variability in susceptibility not only to carcinogens, but also to DNA binding atherogens.
12943735	Regulation of differential COUP-TF-coregulator interactions in adrenal cortical steroidogenesis.	Hyperfunctioning adrenocortical adenomas produce excessive amounts of various corticosteroids due to dysregulated expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Since no genetic mutations in steroidogenic enzyme genes have been identified as yet, the dysregulated expression at the transcription level may be crucial. Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of steroidogenic P450 genes. Transfection studies showed that SF-1 activated and COUP-TFs repressed the transcription of bovine CYP17 gene promoter from the CRS2 element in a mutually exclusive manner in Y-1 cells. The results indicate that COUP-TFs negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of SF-1, a steroidogenic cell-specific activator of various steroidogenic P450 genes. Expression of both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII was significantly decreased in the cortisol-producing adenomas, in which CYP17 was drastically overexpressed, indicating that decreased expression of COUP-TFs play a key role in overexpression of CYP17 in this type of tumors. We then screened for COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a cortisol-producing adenoma cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified a novel RING finger-containing protein which can function as a coregulator for COUP-TFI. Notably, COUP-TFI activated rather than repressed several target genes including the human CYP11B2 gene promoter, the results of which were opposite to those of the CYP17 promoter. The bifunctional activities of COUP-TFI may be derived from the promoter context and our newly identified COUP-TFI coregulator.
10998441	Expression analysis of RET and the GDNF/GFRalpha-1 and NTN/GFRalpha-2 ligand complexes in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.	Pheochromocytoma and its extra-adrenal counterpart paraganglioma are rare catecholamine producing tumors which usually occur sporadically but may also be a part of neuroendocrine tumor syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A). Activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene which is the underlying cause of MEN 2A, is also seen in approximately 10% of sporadic pheochromocytomas. Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) have been shown to function as independent ligands to RET, binding in a complex with the membrane-bound receptors GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 respectively. Here we have investigated the mRNA expression of RET and its ligand complexes, GDNF/GFRalpha-1 and NTN/GFRalpha-2, in a panel of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas using mRNA in situ hybridization. RET expression was evident in normal adrenal medulla, and in 13/15 pheochromocytomas, including 5/5 MEN 2A associated tumors, but only in 1/10 paragangliomas. The frequent expression of RET in the pheochromocytomas suggest that this gene might be involved in the tumorigenesis. However, no expression of GDNF/GFRalpha-1 or NTN/GFRalpha-2 could be detected in any of the 25 tumors analyzed, suggesting that these ligand complexes are not important in the development of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.
9400016	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid release from CA1 neurons of rat hippocampal slices.	In the present study we investigated electrophysiologically the nicotinic responses of pyramidal neurons and interneurons visualized by infrared-assisted videomicroscopy and fluorescence in the CA1 field of hippocampal slices obtained from 8- to 24-day-old rats. Application of nicotinic agonists to CA1 neurons evoked at least four types of nicotinic responses. Of major interest was the ability of these agonists to induce the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from interneurons. Slowly decaying ACh whole-cell currents and GABA-mediated postsynaptic currents could be recorded from pyramidal neurons and interneurons, whereas fast-decaying nicotinic currents and fast current transients were recorded only from interneurons. Nicotinic responses were sensitive to blockade by d-tubocurarine (10 microM), which indicated that they were mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The slowly decaying currents, the postsynaptic currents and the fast current transients were insensitive to blockade by the alpha-7 nAChR-specific antagonist methyllycaconitine (up to 1 microM) or alpha-bungarotoxin (100 nM). On the other hand, the slowly decaying nicotinic currents recorded from the interneurons were blocked by the alpha4beta2 nAChR-specific antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine, and the fast-desensitizing nicotinic currents were evoked by the alpha-7 nAChR-specific agonist choline. In experimental conditions similar to those used to record nicotinic responses from neurons in slice (i. e., in the absence of tetrodotoxin), we observed that nicotinic agonists can also induce the release of GABA from hippocampal neurons in culture. In summary, these results provide direct evidence for more than one subtype of functional nAChR in CA1 neurons and suggest that activation of nAChRs present in GABAergic interneurons can evoke inhibitory activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons, thereby modulating processing of information in the hippocampus.
11906979	Preferences for gender of family physician among Canadian European-descent and South-Asian immigrant women.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate expressed preferences for family physician (FP) gender among Canadian European-descent (CED) and Canadian South-Asian (CSA) immigrant women. METHOD: An 'on-site' survey was conducted in community-based institutions in Toronto in order to determine preferences for the gender of FP under various health care scenarios: overall health care; gender-sensitive examinations; emotional problems; general ailments; and life-threatening conditions. RESULTS: Ninety-four women responded to this survey (CED = 50, CSA = 44), response rate 77.3%. For all health care scenarios, CED and CSA women similarly expressed either a preference for a female FP or no preference. More than two-thirds of women preferred a female FP for gynaecological examinations (CED, 72.9%; CSA, 83.7%) or examinations with private body part exposure (CED, 72%; CSA, 81.8%). For 'emotional problems', half of the women preferred a female FP and the other half had no preference. A similar pattern was observed for 'overall health care', with some shift to female physician preference among CSA women (60.5%) compared with CED women (53.2%). For the 'overall health care' scenario, CED and CSA women who preferred a female FP had a higher frequency of seeing female physicians within the last 5 years (CED, P < or = 0.01; CSA, P < or = 0.05), and attributed 'positive' social skills more to female physicians (CED, P < or = 0.01; CSA, P < or = 0.01) compared with women with no preference for the gender of the FP. Yet, CED women with a female FP preference were more likely to have a concurrent female FP (P < or = 0.01), and to rate past experiences with female physicians as high (P < or = 0.01) and with male physicians as low (P < or = 0.05) compared with CED women with no preference. In the CSA group, women with a preference for a female FP were more likely to be unemployed (P < or = 0.01) and have low social support (P < or = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar physician gender preference patterns, factors associated with these preferences show some differences between CED and CSA women.
8807576	Cytokine gene expression in the MRL/lpr model of lupus nephritis.	The murine MRL/lpr model of lupus nephritis is characterized by a systemic autoimmune syndrome closely resembling the human disease. The lpr mutation represents a defect in the expression of the apoptosis-signaling Fas antigen gene which causes accelerated autoimmune disease in MRL/ lpr mice and a milder, non-lethal autoimmune syndrome in C57BL6-lpr/lpr mice. The role of cytokines in autoimmune pathogenesis and its relationship with the lpr mutation remains poorly understood. In this study we utilized a RNase protection assay to quantitatively and simultaneously examine the expression of 10 different cytokine genes, namely IL-1 alpha, II-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta in kidney, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes obtained from pre-diseased and diseased lupus-prone MRL/lpr, pre-diseased MRL/+2 and C57BL/6-lpr mice, as well as healthy non-autoimmune C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice. Diseased MRL/lpr mice demonstrated marked and predominant IL-1 beta gene upregulation in kidneys, liver, lymph nodes and spleen. Increased message for both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma genes was also observed in lymph nodes, and less consistently, in the spleen, and kidneys derived from diseased MRL/lpr mice as compared to pre-diseased MRL/+2 or normal nonautoimmune control mice. Furthermore, a modest increase in the expression of both IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma message was observed in lymphoid organs of pre-diseased MRL/lpr and C57BL/6-lpr mice compared with MRL/+2 and C57BL/6 controls, respectively. Increased IL-1 beta gene expression was associated with the presence of the lpr mutation, was observed during the prediseased stage, and increased during active disease in both male and female mice. In summary, these results demonstrate that generalized up-regulation of IL-1 beta gene expression, in concert with a more limited up-regulation of both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma expression, are prominent features of the autoimmune syndrome in the MRL/lpr model of SLE and may contribute to the disease-accelerating effect of the lpr mutation.
8976607	Identifying and distinguishing sibling species in the Tetrahymena pyriformis complex (Ciliophora, Oligohymenophorea) using PCR/RFLP analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA.	We describe a riboprinting strategy for identifying and distinguishing among sibling species in the Tetrahymena pyriformis complex. It involves use of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a large segment of the nuclear ribosomal DNA and internal transcribed spacers, and digestion of this DNA with restriction enzymes. Unique restriction fragment length patterns or haplotypes were then used to distinguish species into: (1) six taxa that were identifiable to the species level, (2) eight taxa that were separated into four pairs, and (3) a group of eight taxa that were identical to each other. The latter result indicates that a more variable molecule is needed to distinguish the most closely related species in the complex. There was no intraspecific variation between two strains from one species (Tetrahymena thermophila) nor among multiple isolates from another species (Tetrahymena empidokyrea). This approach provides an alternative to traditional techniques for identifying T. pyriformis species that require living reference specimens and/or that reveal high levels of intraspecific variation.
7817779	The importance of family study in the patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a well-known autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of familial polyposis coli, and both can be associated with colonic or extracolonic benign and/or malignant tumors. It has been widely recognized that an adenocarcinoma of the colon develops in virtually all cases, usually at an earlier age, if polyps are left untreated. Families of four individuals diagnosed of FAP were surveyed and 56 relatives of the families were examined. Of these 56, 21 had multiple colon polyps, 3 of whom had early-stage adenocarcinomas. We consider that familial survey of FAP individuals can be of considerable benefit for this high-risk population due to the autosomal nature of the disease, allowing diagnosis of an associated cancer at an earlier stage.
7789307	Electron microscopic visualization of insulin translocation into the cytoplasm and nuclei of intact H35 hepatoma cells using covalently linked Nanogold-insulin.	Insulin affects numerous metabolic processes as well as nuclear events such as gene transcription. Our previous ultrastructural and biochemical studies demonstrated insulin accumulation in nuclei of cultured and rapidly proliferating cells, and biochemical evidence suggested that insulin entered the cell cytoplasm before accumulating in the nucleus. The present study was undertaken to develop a covalently linked electron-dense insulin complex that could be used to visualize the intracellular translocation of insulin and confirm that insulin enters the cytoplasm of cells. Insulin was cross-linked to 1.4-nm diameter Nanogold particles. The complex binds to the plasma membrane insulin receptor, is biologically active, and is degraded by cellular insulin-degradative enzymes. Ultrastructural analysis after silver intensification of the gold particles confirmed that insulin internalization culminates in the translocation of some internalized insulin to the cytoplasm and nuclei. When cytoplasmic insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) activity was inhibited with 1,10-phenanthroline, an increase in the number of cytoplasmic and nuclear Nanogold-insulin particles was observed. The results of this and previous studies suggest that 1) the translocation of insulin to the cytoplasm, 2) the regulation of insulin degradation in the cytoplasm by IDE, 3) the possible interaction of insulin with cytoplasmic proteins other than IDE, and 4) the subsequent accumulation of intact insulin or insulin complexed with cytoplasmic proteins in nuclei may play a role in insulin's regulation of gene transcription and cell proliferation.
11023838	Purified recombinant insulin-degrading enzyme degrades amyloid beta-protein but does not promote its oligomerization.	Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has been implicated as an early and essential factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Although its cellular production has been studied extensively, little is known about Abeta clearance. Recently, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a 110-kDa metalloendopeptidase, was found to degrade both endogenously secreted and synthetic Abeta peptides. Surprisingly, IDE-mediated proteolysis of [(125)I]Abeta(1-40) in microglial cell-culture media was accompanied by the formation of (125)I-labelled peptides with higher apparent molecular masses, raising the possibility that the degradation products act as 'seeds' for Abeta oligomerization. To directly address the role of IDE in Abeta degradation and oligomerization, we investigated the action of purified recombinant wild-type and catalytically inactive IDEs. Our data demonstrate that (i) IDE alone is sufficient to cleave purified Abeta that is either unlabelled, iodinated or (35)S-labelled; (ii) the initial cleavage sites are His(14)-Gln(15), Phe(19)-Phe(20) and Phe(20)-Ala(21); and (iii) incubation of IDE with [(125)I]Abeta, but not with [(35)S]-Abeta, leads to the formation of slower migrating species on gels. Since iodination labels N-terminal fragments of Abeta, and (35)S labels C-terminal products, we analysed unlabelled synthetic fragments of Abeta and determined that only the N-terminal fragments migrate with anomalously high molecular mass. These results indicate that IDE alone is sufficient to degrade Abeta at specific sites, and that its degradation products do not promote oligomerization of the intact Abeta peptide.
12543071	Visualizing RNA molecules inside the nucleus of living cells.	Fluorescence in situ hybridization is a widely used technique in cell biology providing insight into the spatial organization of specific RNA transcripts in the cell nucleus. However, to further investigate the dynamics of the transcription process and the transport rates of RNAs through the nucleus, RNAs need to be visualized and tracked in the living cell. In past years, various methods have been developed with the aim of tagging specific RNAs with a fluorescent moiety without interfering with cell vitality. These methods include the delivery of probes into a living cell, the in vivo hybridization of fluorescent oligonucleotide probes to endogenous RNAs, and the microscopic imaging of the tagged RNAs in living cells. In this article, we review a number of methods for tagging and visualizing endogenous RNAs in living cells. In addition, a protocol is described that allows detection of various RNA types using fluorochrome-labeled 2(')-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide (2(')-OMe RNA) probes. Compared with conventional oligodeoxynucleotide probes, 2(')-OMe RNA probes are not degraded by nucleases, form stable hybrids with structured RNAs, and do not interfere with cell vitality.
9014232	No association between c-fos gene polymorphisms and sporadic Alzheimer's disease.	Although ApoE epsilon 4 is a major risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20-30% of sporadic AD patients do not have this allele. This indicates that other risk factors are involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. Studies of the genetic association between AD and polymorphisms in the c-fos gene, a candidate gene for AD, were conducted. The polymorphisms of DsaI in exon 2 and Sau3 AI in intron 2 were examined in 89 patients diagnosed as sporadic cases of probable AD clinically and radiologically according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. This was also undertaken in 96 controls. There was no significant difference between the groups in allele frequencies or genotype counts. Although c-fos gene as a locus conferring susceptibility to sporadic AD cannot be ruled out, these data could not support the hypothesis that a c-fos allele should be another risk factor for sporadic AD.
10748548	[Distribution of causes of death in communities with different urbanization levels].	The aim of the present work was to compare mortality data during 1980-94 (24 causes of death for males and 25 for females) in populations living in municipalities with different urbanization levels of seven Italian regions (Piemonte, Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Marche, Lazio, Campania and Sicilia). Urbanization levels were established following the classification of the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT, Classificazione dei comuni secondo le caratteristiche urbane e rurali, 1986). A quite uniform configuration of causes of death with characteristic excesses in the urban environment was evident. The only exception was represented by the male population in Lombardia, probably due to the prevalence of occupational exposure. The urban excesses included: all tumors (also for the population < 64 year old), trachea, bronchi and lung tumors (also < 64 year old people), colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, male liver cancer and female breast cancer. Mortality due to stomach cancer and, only in males, to larynx cancer was lower in urban than in the other types areas, except the Southern regions. Concerning some non tumoral pathologies a more dyshomogeneous situation was observed, with a prevalence of urban defects in Piemonte and Lombardia, of urban excesses in the Southern regions and of both excesses and defects in Emilia Romagna and the Central regions. The "semi-rural" and "rural" types municipalities resulted quite similar, with the exception of Campania and Lazio. In fact, in these two regions a greater association with stomach cancer and lower mortality for all other tumors compared to the urban and, at a lesser extent, to the semi-urban municipalities was found. However, the lower tumor mortality was partly balanced by some other causes of death, again with the exception of Campania and at a lesser extent of Sicilia. On the basis of the causes of death comparisons, the semi-urban municipalities seem to represent a transition type between the urban and the rural ones.
12388617	Dopamine modulates the response of the human amygdala: a study in Parkinson's disease.	In addition to classic motor signs and symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by neuropsychological and emotional deficits, including a blunted emotional response. In the present study, we explored both the neural basis of abnormal emotional behavior in PD and the physiological effects of dopaminergic therapy on the response of the amygdala, a central structure in emotion processing. PD patients and matched normal controls (NCs) were studied with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a paradigm that involved perceptual processing of fearful stimuli. PD patients were studied twice, once during a relatively hypodopaminergic state (i.e., > or =12 hr after their last dose of dopamimetic treatment) and again during a dopamine-replete state. The imaging data revealed a robust bilateral amygdala response in NCs that was absent in PD patients during the hypodopaminergic state. Dopamine repletion partially restored this response in PD patients. Our results demonstrate an abnormal amygdala response in PD that may underlie the emotional deficits accompanying the disease. Furthermore, consistent with findings in experimental animal paradigms, our results provide in vivo evidence of the role of dopamine in modulating the response of the amygdala to sensory information in human subjects.
11479207	Aberrant methylation and simian virus 40 tag sequences in malignant mesothelioma.	Aberrant promoter methylation and resultant silencing of several genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many tumor types. We compared the methylation profile of 66 malignant mesotheliomas (MMs) and 40 lung adenocarcinomas using methylation-specific PCR for seven genes frequently methylated in lung cancer. We also compared the methylation frequencies of these genes as well as the methylation index, a reflection of all of the gene frequencies, with the presence of SV40 large T-antigen (Tag) sequences, histological subtype, and patient survival. Our major findings are: (a) with the exception of the RASSF1A promoter of the RASSF1 gene, frequencies of aberrant methylation were significantly lower in MMs than in adenocarcinomas; (b) the frequency of RASSF1A aberrant methylation and the value of the methylation index were significantly higher in SV40 sequence positive MM than in negative MM; and (c) the methylation index was higher in epithelial MM than in sarcomatous/mixed MM. Our results demonstrate a relationship between SV40 and aberrant methylation in MMs.
12578942	Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with MM1-type prion protein and plaques.	The authors report a 75-year-old woman with atypical sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) characterized by MM1-type prion protein (PrP) (methionine homozygosity at codon 129 in the PrP gene and type-1 protease-resistant PrP) and PrP plaques. This patient is the first case of sporadic CJD with plaque-forming MM1-type PrP, suggesting either a shared prion strain with the plaque-forming subset of dural graft-associated CJD or shared host genetic factors that are unrelated to the PrP genotype.
9009165	Human ovarian-carcinoma cell lines express IL-4 and IL-13 receptors: comparison between IL-4- and IL-13-induced signal transduction.	We have reported that human ovarian-carcinoma cell lines express high-affinity IL-4 receptor. Since IL-4R has been hypothesized to share a chain with IL-13R, we investigated whether ovarian cancer cells express IL-13 receptor. In the present study, we report that the ovarian-carcinoma cell lines IGROV-1 and PA-1 express varying numbers of high-affinity IL-13 receptors. Furthermore, IL-13 inhibited the binding of IL-4 on both ovarian-carcinoma cell lines, while IL-4 did not inhibit IL-13 binding on IGROV-1 cell line. IL-13 and IL-4 induced the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 Janus kinases in PA-1 cells. In contrast, JAK3 tyrosine kinase was expressed in PA-1 cells, but IL-4 or IL-13 did not augment its phosphorylation. In IGROV-1 cells, Tyk2 was constitutively phosphorylated and this phosphorylation was augmented by IL-4 or IL-13. JAK1 and JAK2 but not JAK3 were expressed but only JAK2 was faintly phosphorylated in response to either IL-13 or IL-4 respectively. IRS (insulin-receptor substrate)-1 and IRS-2 were also phosphorylated constitutively in both ovarian cancer cell lines examined, but only the phosphorylation of IRS-1 was augmented in response to IL-4 or IL-13. STAT6 was phosphorylated and activated in response to IL-4 and IL-13 in all cell lines examined. Our results demonstrate that ovarian cancer cell lines may express 2 types of IL-13R and the IL-13- or IL-4-induced signaling patterns may be slightly different in each type of receptor.
8927950	[Multiple sclerosis: therapy with recombinant beta-1b interferon: initial results with 30 multiple sclerosis patients in northwest Switzerland].	Recombinant interferon beta-1b has been registered with the Swiss health authorities since August 1995. Due to a special arrangement with health insurances it has been possible to prescribe this medication since spring 1995. We report on our experience with the first 30 consecutively treated multiple sclerosis patients. Indication, adverse event profile and clinical response to treatment are described. The most common side effects were local injection site reactions (63%), influenza-like symptoms (50%) and fatigue (33%). As compared to the prestudy period we observed a 49% reduction in the exacerbation rate. Compliance was excellent, possibly due to strict selection and extensive information about possible effects and side effects.
8728952	[Evaluation of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance system in 1994].	Increased by 40.2% compared with 1993, 3142 acute flaccidparalysis cases were reported from AFP surveillance system in 1994. A total number of 1297 counties had AFP cases reported, accounting for 45.1% of total amount of counties. Out of 3142 AFP cases, 307 were confirmed, coming from 225 counties. For children under 15 years old, the reported AFP incidence was 1.1/10(5), non-polio AFP rate was 0.83/10(5), much higher than 0.37/10(5), in 1993. 48.5% of the total AFP cases had double stool specimen taken within 0-14 days after paralysis. 79% AFP cases had been investigated within 48 hours after being reported. Some of the major monitoring indicators of AFP surveillance system were close to the WHO criterion, but the percentage of AFP cases reported within 48 hours of careseeking and AFP cases with follow-up visit after 60-70 days of paralysis were very low. Furthermore, 77.9% of the confirmed cases were diagnosea clinically by residual paralysis, so did the 46.4% of discarded cases. It is in urgent need to increase the percentage of cases classified by laboratory test.
10520943	Course of depression during the initiation of interferon beta-1a treatment for multiple sclerosis.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that increases in depression after initiation of treatment with interferon beta-1a for multiple sclerosis can be explained as representing a return to pretreatment levels of depression. DESIGN: Level of depression in patients with multiple sclerosis was assessed at 3 time points: 2 weeks before initiation of interferon beta-la treatment, at initiation of treatment, and at 2-month follow-up. SETTING: A health maintenance organization. PATIENTS: Fifty-six patients with confirmed relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The depression-dejection scale of the Profile of Mood States. RESULTS: Patients who scored high on the depression measure 2 weeks before the initiation of interferon beta-1a treatment showed significant reduction in depression at the initiation of treatment. However, depression returned nearly to initial levels within 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that increases in depression after initiation of interferon beta-1a treatment are related to level of depression 2 weeks before initiation of treatment. Physicians should assess history of depression for all patients in whom interferon beta-1a treatment is initiated. Patients with a recent history of depression are at risk for increased depression within 2 months after starting interferon beta-1a treatment, even though they may not be depressed at the time of treatment initiation.
12799033	Leptin as a marker of multiple sclerosis activity in patients treated with interferon-beta.	The role of leptin was investigated in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Control and MS patients showed comparable baseline serum leptin levels. During the first year of IFNbeta-1a treatment, leptin significantly decreased since 2 months after starting therapy in 11 patients who had no relapses. A significant decrease in IL12/IL10 ratio was observed in this group of patients only after 1 year of treatment. An increase of leptin was observed before the first clinical exacerbation in 13 relapsing patients. Leptin may play a pathogenic role in MS and can be a useful marker of disease activity and response to therapy.
11239554	Altered autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the ovary of a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) in the ovary of a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was reduced compared to normal. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. PATIENT(S): One woman with PCOS and one healthy control, both of whom underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. INTERVENTION(S): Plasma membrane fraction of ovarian tissue was isolated, and the IR was purified and concentrated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Western blots of the IR, which had been incubated with and without insulin, were prepared. Colorimetric and chemiluminescent methods were used to detect the presence of the IR beta-subunit and IR tyrosine autophosphorylation, respectively. RESULT(S): The presence of the beta-subunit of the IR was identified in both ovarian samples. The degree of insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine autophosphorylation, reflected by the mean (+/-SD) relative optical density of the 95 kd band, was 4.3-fold higher in the normal ovary compared to the PCOS ovary (0.56 +/- 0.18 optical density vs. 0.13 +/- 0.10 optical density, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IR may be decreased in the ovaries of women with PCOS, similar to the findings in other tissues. The mechanisms through which insulin acts to produce an excess in ovarian androgen production in the face of a decrease in ovarian IR autophosphorylation remain to be determined.
