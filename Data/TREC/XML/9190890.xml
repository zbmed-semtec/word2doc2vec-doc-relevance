    The p53 protein is known to play a central role in mediating G1 arrest or apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation in some cell types. It has been proposed that the link between p53 and induction of apoptosis is provided in part by p53-mediated upregulation of BAX. In this study, we used the human SW626 ovarian cancer cell line, which lacks functional p53, to further investigate the relationship between wildtype p53, BAX, and apoptosis. SW626 cells expressing a temperature sensitive (ts) p53 mutant did not undergo G1 arrest or apoptosis and did not exhibit enhanced sensitivity to radiation at the permissive temperature of 32 degrees C. The tsp53 protein was functional in these cells as evidenced by rapid induction of p21 at 32 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. Interestingly, restoration of wildtype p53 function at 32 degrees C was not associated with BAX upregulation. In addition, stable overexpression of BAX in SW626 cells was not capable of enhancing apoptotic cell death in response to radiation. Thus, failure of p53 to upregulate BAX is not the sole reason for its inability to promote radiation-induced apoptosis in SW626 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that neither p53 nor BAX upregulation is sufficient for the induction of apoptosis in response to genotoxic damage in some cell types.
