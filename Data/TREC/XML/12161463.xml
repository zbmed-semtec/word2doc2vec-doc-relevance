    Cystic fibrosis (CF), a chloride ion transport disorder, is caused by mutations of the cftr gene and is the most common autosomal-recessive heritable disease in Caucasians. CFTR knockout mice have enamel with crystallite defects, retained protein, and hypomineralization, suggesting a role for CFTR in enamel formation and mineralization. This investigation examined CFTR expression and elemental composition in developing murine incisor teeth. RT-PCR showed cftr mRNA expression in the normal mouse apical incisor tissue but not in the CFTR knockout tissue. Elemental analysis by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy showed relatively decreased chloride in secretory-stage CF enamel. Iron and potassium were significantly increased, and calcium was significantly decreased (p value = 0.05) in the CF mature enamel. Abnormal enamel mineralization, ion concentrations, and molecular evidence of cftr mRNA expression by odontogenic cells strongly suggest that CFTR plays an important role in enamel formation.
