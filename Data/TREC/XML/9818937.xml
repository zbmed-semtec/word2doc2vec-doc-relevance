    A recent study showed modest evidence for an increased frequency of the bleomycin hydrolase (BH) V/V genotype in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared with non-demented controls. To test this hypothesis, we examined this polymorphism in 621 rigorously evaluated patients and 502 control subjects (all caucasian) but were unable to detect an association between BH and AD even after controlling for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. We conclude that this polymorphism does not account for inherited susceptibility to AD in the populations represented in this sample.
