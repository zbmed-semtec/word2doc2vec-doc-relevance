    Great progress has been made with respect to our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of AIDS and the infectious agent, HIV, that causes the disease. HIV, a human retrovirus with tropism for CD4(+) T cells and monocytes, induces a decrease of T-cell counts, T-cell dysfunction, and, ultimately, immunodeficiency. HIV also causes B-cell dysfunction characterized by polyclonal activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and lack of specific antibody responses. Chemokine receptors-mainly CCR5 and CXCR4-have been found to be necessary for viral entry into the host cell, a step that can be inhibited by chemokine-related molecules that are ligands for those receptors. After HIV infection, a strong cellular immunity develops and partially controls viral replication. It can take several years for HIV infection to become clinically evident. Studies in long-term nonprogressors have shown the determinant roles of both helper and cytotoxic T cells in the control of HIV disease. Advances in HIV immunology research are currently being applied in the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.
