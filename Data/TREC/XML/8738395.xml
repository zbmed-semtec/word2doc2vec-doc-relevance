    The expression levels of nm23-H1 have been reported to correlate with the metastatic potential of some tumours. We have treated a child with a rare case of astrocytoma with diffuse osteoblastic metastases. We therefore decided to examine the expression of the nm23 gene product in 24 gliomas in order to clarify the association of its expression with the clinical features of the disease. A polyclonal antibody against a GST/nm23-H1 fusion protein was raised in rabbits. Twenty-four specimens, including 5 recurrent gliomas and one extraneural metastasis, were obtained from 19 patients treated surgically between 1990 and 1993 in our hospital. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on paraffin sections using an avidin-biotinyl peroxidase complex method. Of the 24 astrocytic neoplasms, 3 (12.5%) specimens from one patient with diffuse bony metastases stained intensely with nm23-H1. Two specimens obtained from glioblastoma multiforme patients stained weakly. The other 19 specimens were negative for nm23-H1 expression. Little or no nm23 expression was observed in adjacent nontumourous cerebral tissues. The results suggest that high levels of nm23 expression might correlate with extraneural metastatic potential in astrocytic neoplasms.
