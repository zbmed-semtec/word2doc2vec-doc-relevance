    Ninety-eight women ascertained from high-risk breast/ovarian cancer clinics with breast cancer reporting at least one other primary cancer in themselves or in a relative with breast cancer were compared with 99 women with breast cancer who reported a family history of breast cancer only. All DNA was screened for coding region mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 using heteroduplex analysis, followed by direct sequencing. Our data indicate that 42.9% of families reporting breast and any second nonbreast type of primary cancer in the same individual had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, as compared with the 12.1% of families reporting breast cancer only (P &lt; 0.001). Among the 66 women reporting breast cancer and a nonovarian second primary cancer, 15 (22.7%) had mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P = 0.04). Among the 32 families where ovarian cancer was the second primary cancer, 27 (84.4%) had a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P &lt; 0.001). BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were twice as common in the presence of a reported second nonovarian cancer. These data suggest that the presence of multiple primary cancer of any kind may predict for an increased likelihood of finding a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and supports previous studies suggesting that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be associated with an increased susceptibility to cancers other than breast and ovarian cancer.
