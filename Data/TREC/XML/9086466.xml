    One isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE), a protein primarily involved in transport of lipids, is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, fragments of apoE are deposited in the amyloid that invariantly are found in brain tissue of disease victims. An intriguing possibility is therefore that increased levels of apoE are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Levels of full-length apoE in cerebrospinal fluid from 13 Alzheimer patients and 12 healthy controls were determined using Western blotting technique. Levels of the protein were essentially identical to previously reported findings and no difference between patients and healthy controls was found. Hence, it is concluded that increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of apoE are not involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and that measurement of CSF apoE levels does not seem to be useful as a diagnostic procedure.
