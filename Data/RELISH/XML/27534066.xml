    This study was aimed to compare mFISH and mBAND techniques in assessment of the yield of chromosomal aberrations induced by high-LET ionizing radiation. The study group included Mayak workers (46 individuals), for whom the yield of chromosomal aberrations was assessed using two methods: mFISH and mBAND. It was shown that both methods are applicable for biological indication of internal α-radiation exposure. Nevertheless, in case when the source of ionizing radiation is unknown or in terms of a mixed exposure, mFISH appeared as more informative technique that allows identification of markers both external γ-rays (translocations) and internal α-radiation (complex chromosomal rearrangements).
