22836504	Intramolecular uncoupling of chromophore photoconversion from structural signaling determinants drive mutant phytochrome B photoreceptor to far-red light perception.	The phytochrome (phy) photoreceptor family regulates almost all aspects of plant development in a broad range of light environments including seed germination, onset of the photomorphogenic program in seedling stage, the shade avoidance syndrome in competing plant communities, flowering induction and senescence of adult plants. During evolution two clearly distinct classes of phy-s emerged covering these very different physiological tasks. ( 1)  PhyA is rapidly degraded in its activated state. PhyA functions in controlling seed germination at very low light intensities (very low fluence response, VLFR) and seedling establishment under photosynthetic shade conditions (high irradiance response, HIR) where the far-red portion of the transmitted light to understorey habitats is substantially enhanced. Arabidopsis phyB together with phyC, D and E belongs to the relatively stable sensor class in comparison to the light labile phyA. PhyB functions at all stages of development including seed germination and seedling establishment, mediates classical red/far-red reversible low fluence responses (LFR) as well as red light high irradiance responses, and it is considered to be the dominating phytochrome sensor of its class.
21963675	Progress in understanding and controlling respiratory syncytial virus: still crazy after all these years.	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that infects everyone worldwide early in life and is a leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in the pediatric population as well as in the elderly and in profoundly immunosuppressed individuals. RSV is an enveloped, nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus that is classified in Family Paramyxoviridae and is one of its more complex members. Although the replicative cycle of RSV follows the general pattern of the Paramyxoviridae, it encodes additional proteins. Two of these (NS1 and NS2) inhibit the host type I and type III interferon (IFN) responses, among other functions, and another gene encodes two novel RNA synthesis factors (M2-1 and M2-2). The attachment (G) glycoprotein also exhibits unusual features, such as high sequence variability, extensive glycosylation, cytokine mimicry, and a shed form that helps the virus evade neutralizing antibodies. RSV is notable for being able to efficiently infect early in life, with the peak of hospitalization at 2-3 months of age. It also is notable for the ability to reinfect symptomatically throughout life without need for significant antigenic change, although immunity from prior infection reduces disease. It is widely thought that re-infection is due to an ability of RSV to inhibit or subvert the host immune response. Mechanisms of viral pathogenesis remain controversial. RSV is notable for a historic, tragic pediatric vaccine failure involving a formalin-inactivated virus preparation that was evaluated in the 1960s and that was poorly protective and paradoxically primed for enhanced RSV disease. RSV also is notable for the development of a successful strategy for passive immunoprophylaxis of high-risk infants using RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Vaccines and new antiviral drugs are in pre-clinical and clinical development, but controlling RSV remains a formidable challenge.
26133087	Probabilistic Analysis of Localized DNA Hybridization Circuits.	Molecular devices made of nucleic acids can perform complex information processing tasks at the nanoscale, with potential applications in biofabrication and smart therapeutics. However, limitations in the speed and scalability of such devices in a well-mixed setting can significantly affect their performance. In this article, we propose designs for localized circuits involving DNA molecules that are arranged on addressable substrates and interact via hybridization reactions. We propose designs for localized elementary logic circuits, which we compose to produce more complex devices, including a circuit for computing the square root of a four bit number. We develop an efficient method for probabilistic model checking of localized circuits, which we implement within the Visual DSD design tool. We use this method to prove the correctness of our circuits with respect to their functional specifications and to analyze their performance over a broad range of local rate parameters. Specifically, we analyze the extent to which our localized designs can overcome the limitations of well-mixed circuits, with respect to speed and scalability. To provide an estimate of local rate parameters, we propose a biophysical model of localized hybridization. Finally, we use our analysis to identify constraints in the rate parameters that enable localized circuits to retain their advantages in the presence of unintended interferences between strands.
28002450	Seeing It All: Evaluating Supervised Machine Learning Methods for the Classification of Diverse Otariid Behaviours.	Constructing activity budgets for marine animals when they are at sea and cannot be directly observed is challenging, but recent advances in bio-logging technology offer solutions to this problem. Accelerometers can potentially identify a wide range of behaviours for animals based on unique patterns of acceleration. However, when analysing data derived from accelerometers, there are many statistical techniques available which when applied to different data sets produce different classification accuracies. We investigated a selection of supervised machine learning methods for interpreting behavioural data from captive otariids (fur seals and sea lions). We conducted controlled experiments with 12 seals, where their behaviours were filmed while they were wearing 3-axis accelerometers. From video we identified 26 behaviours that could be grouped into one of four categories (foraging, resting, travelling and grooming) representing key behaviour states for wild seals. We used data from 10 seals to train four predictive classification models: stochastic gradient boosting (GBM), random forests, support vector machine using four different kernels and a baseline model: penalised logistic regression. We then took the best parameters from each model and cross-validated the results on the two seals unseen so far. We also investigated the influence of feature statistics (describing some characteristic of the seal), testing the models both with and without these. Cross-validation accuracies were lower than training accuracy, but the SVM with a polynomial kernel was still able to classify seal behaviour with high accuracy (>70%). Adding feature statistics improved accuracies across all models tested. Most categories of behaviour -resting, grooming and feeding-were all predicted with reasonable accuracy (52-81%) by the SVM while travelling was poorly categorised (31-41%). These results show that model selection is important when classifying behaviour and that by using animal characteristics we can strengthen the overall accuracy.
28197155	Dissecting the Biochemical and Transcriptomic Effects of a Locally Applied Heat Treatment on Developing Cabernet Sauvignon Grape Berries.	Reproductive development of grapevine and berry composition are both strongly influenced by temperature. To date, the molecular mechanisms involved in grapevine berries response to high temperatures are poorly understood. Unlike recent data that addressed the effects on berry development of elevated temperatures applied at the whole plant level, the present work particularly focuses on the fruit responses triggered by direct exposure to heat treatment (HT). In the context of climate change, this work focusing on temperature effect at the microclimate level is of particular interest as it can help to better understand the consequences of leaf removal (a common viticultural practice) on berry development. HT (+ 8°C) was locally applied to clusters from Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting cuttings at three different developmental stages (middle green, veraison and middle ripening). Samples were collected 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment and used for metabolic and transcriptomic analyses. The results showed dramatic and specific biochemical and transcriptomic changes in heat exposed berries, depending on the developmental stage and the stress duration. When applied at the herbaceous stage, HT delayed the onset of veraison. Heating also strongly altered the berry concentration of amino acids and organic acids (e.g., phenylalanine, γ-aminobutyric acid and malate) and decreased the anthocyanin content at maturity. These physiological alterations could be partly explained by the deep remodeling of transcriptome in heated berries. More than 7000 genes were deregulated in at least one of the nine experimental conditions. The most affected processes belong to the categories "stress responses," "protein metabolism" and "secondary metabolism," highlighting the intrinsic capacity of grape berries to perceive HT and to build adaptive responses. Additionally, important changes in processes related to "transport," "hormone" and "cell wall" might contribute to the postponing of veraison. Finally, opposite effects depending on heating duration were observed for genes encoding enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid pathway, suggesting that the HT-induced decrease in anthocyanin content may result from a combination of transcript abundance and product degradation.
27038686	Independent Analysis of Albumin-Bilirubin Grade in a 765-Patient Cohort Treated with Transarterial Locoregional Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	PURPOSE: To assess validity of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade as a predictor of survival in patients undergoing transarterial embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline albumin and bilirubin values of 765 consecutive patients treated with conventional transarterial chemoembolization or yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization at a single institution were used to determine liver function according to ALBI grade. Survival outcomes were stratified by ALBI grade using Kaplan-Meier and stratified by Child-Pugh (C-P) class and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. Discriminatory ability was assessed by C-index. RESULTS: For 428 patients receiving (90)Y radioembolization, ALBI grade yielded distinct survival curves (P < .001). When stratified by C-P class and BCLC stage, ALBI grade revealed different survival outcomes for C-P B (P = .001), BCLC A (P < .001), BCLC B (P = .001), and BCLC C (P < .001). When substratified by BCLC stage, ALBI grade was a better discriminator of survival than C-P class (C-index 0.792, 0.763, respectively). For 337 patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization, ALBI grade yielded distinct survival curves (P < .001). When stratified by C-P class and BCLC stage, ALBI grade provided distinct survival curves for C-P B (P = .02), BCLC B (P = .001), and BCLC C (P = .02). When substratified by BCLC stage, ALBI grade was a better discriminator of survival than C-P class (C-index 0.739, 0.735, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ALBI grade outperforms C-P class at discriminating survival in patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization or (90)Y radioembolization. ALBI grade is also valuable in patients with moderate liver dysfunction and BCLC B disease.
28939558	Targeting the MAPK Signaling Pathway in Cancer: Promising Preclinical Activity with the Novel Selective ERK1/2 Inhibitor BVD-523 (Ulixertinib).	Aberrant activation of signaling through the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway is implicated in numerous cancers, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Although BRAF and MEK-targeted combination therapy has demonstrated significant benefit beyond single-agent options, the majority of patients develop resistance and disease progression after approximately 12 months. Reactivation of ERK signaling is a common driver of resistance in this setting. Here we report the discovery of BVD-523 (ulixertinib), a novel, reversible, ATP-competitive ERK1/2 inhibitor with high potency and ERK1/2 selectivity. In vitro BVD-523 treatment resulted in reduced proliferation and enhanced caspase activity in sensitive cells. Interestingly, BVD-523 inhibited phosphorylation of target substrates despite increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In in vivo xenograft studies, BVD-523 showed dose-dependent growth inhibition and tumor regression. BVD-523 yielded synergistic antiproliferative effects in a BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cell line xenograft model when used in combination with BRAF inhibition. Antitumor activity was also demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to single-agent and combination BRAF/MEK-targeted therapy. On the basis of these promising results, these studies demonstrate BVD-523 holds promise as a treatment for ERK-dependent cancers, including those whose tumors have acquired resistance to other treatments targeting upstream nodes of the MAPK pathway. Assessment of BVD-523 in clinical trials is underway (NCT01781429, NCT02296242, and NCT02608229). Mol Cancer Ther; 16(11); 2351-63. ©2017 AACR.
28779435	Acute gastroenteritis in primary care: a longitudinal study in the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network, Sentinella.	PURPOSE: Acute gastroenteritis (AG) leads to considerable burden of disease, health care costs and socio-economic impact worldwide. We assessed the frequency of medical consultations and work absenteeism due to AG at primary care level, and physicians' case management using the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network "Sentinella". METHODS: During the 1-year, longitudinal study in 2014, 172 physicians participating in "Sentinella" reported consultations due to AG including information on clinical presentation, stool diagnostics, treatment, and work absenteeism. RESULTS: An incidence of 2146 first consultations due to AG at primary care level per 100,000 inhabitants in Switzerland was calculated for 2014 based on reported 3.9 thousand cases. Physicians classified patients' general condition at first consultation with a median score of 7 (1 = poor, 10 = good). The majority (92%) of patients received dietary recommendations and/or medical prescriptions; antibiotics were prescribed in 8.5%. Stool testing was initiated in 12.3% of cases; more frequently in patients reporting recent travel. Among employees (15-64 years), 86.3% were on sick leave. Median duration of sick leave was 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of AG in primary care is high and comparable with that of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Switzerland. Work absenteeism is substantial, leading to considerable socio-economic impact. Mandatory infectious disease surveillance underestimates the burden of AG considering that stool testing is not conducted routinely. While a national strategy to reduce the burden of ILI exists, similar comprehensive prevention efforts should be considered for AG.
23782943	Androgens increase survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus by an androgen receptor-dependent mechanism in male rats.	Gonadal steroids are potent regulators of adult neurogenesis. We previously reported that androgens, such as testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but not estradiol, increased the survival of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the male rat. These results suggest androgens regulate hippocampal neurogenesis via the androgen receptor (AR). To test this supposition, we examined the role of ARs in hippocampal neurogenesis using 2 different approaches. In experiment 1, we examined neurogenesis in male rats insensitive to androgens due to a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the AR (termed testicular feminization mutation) compared with wild-type males. In experiment 2, we injected the AR antagonist, flutamide, into castrated male rats and compared neurogenesis levels in the dentate gyrus of DHT and oil-treated controls. In experiment 1, chronic T increased hippocampal neurogenesis in wild-type males but not in androgen-insensitive testicular feminization mutation males. In experiment 2, DHT increased hippocampal neurogenesis via cell survival, an effect that was blocked by concurrent treatment with flutamide. DHT, however, did not affect cell proliferation. Interestingly, cells expressing doublecortin, a marker of immature neurons, did not colabel with ARs in the dentate gyrus, but ARs were robustly expressed in other regions of the hippocampus. Together these studies provide complementary evidence that androgens regulate adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus via the AR but at a site other than the dentate gyrus. Understanding where in the brain androgens act to increase the survival of new neurons in the adult brain may have implications for neurodegenerative disorders.
29700541	Micromechanical characterization of soft, biopolymeric hydrogels: stiffness, resilience, and failure.	Detailed understanding of the local structure-property relationships in soft biopolymeric hydrogels can be instrumental for applications in regenerative tissue engineering. Resilin-like polypeptide (RLP) hydrogels have been previously demonstrated as useful biomaterials with a unique combination of low elastic moduli, excellent resilience, and cell-adhesive properties. However, comprehensive mechanical characterization of RLP hydrogels under both low-strain and high-strain conditions has not yet been conducted, despite the unique information such measurements can provide about the local structure and macromolecular behavior underpinning mechanical properties. In this study, mechanical properties (elastic modulus, resilience, and fracture initiation toughness) of equilibrium swollen resilin-based hydrogels were characterized via oscillatory shear rheology, small-strain microindentation, and large-strain puncture tests as a function of polypeptide concentration. These methods allowed characterization, for the first time, of the resilience and failure in hydrogels with low polypeptide concentrations (<20 wt%), as the employed methods obviate the handling difficulties inherent in the characterization of such soft materials via standard mechanical techniques, allowing characterization without any special sample preparation and requiring minimal volumes (as low as 50 μL). Elastic moduli measured from small-strain microindentation showed good correlation with elastic storage moduli obtained from oscillatory shear rheology at a comparable applied strain rate, and evaluation of multiple loading-unloading cycles revealed decreased resilience values at lower hydrogel concentrations. In addition, large-strain indentation-to-failure (or puncture) tests were performed to measure large-strain mechanical response and fracture toughness on length scales similar to biological cells (∼10-50 μm) at various polypeptide concentrations, indicating very high fracture initiation toughness for high-concentration hydrogels. Our results establish the utility of employing microscale mechanical methods for the characterization of the local mechanical properties of biopolymeric hydrogels of low concentrations (<20 wt%), and show how the combination of small and large-strain measurements can provide unique insight into structure-property relationships for biopolymeric elastomers. Overall, this study provides new insight into the effects on local mechanical properties of polypeptide concentration near the overlap polymer concentration c* for resilin-based hydrogels, confirming their unique elastomeric features for applications in regenerative medicine.
25492406	Clustering-based model of cysteine co-evolution improves disulfide bond connectivity prediction and reduces homologous sequence requirements.	MOTIVATION: Cysteine residues have particular structural and functional relevance in proteins because of their ability to form covalent disulfide bonds. Bioinformatics tools that can accurately predict cysteine bonding states are already available, whereas it remains challenging to infer the disulfide connectivity pattern of unknown protein sequences. Improving accuracy in this area is highly relevant for the structural and functional annotation of proteins. RESULTS: We predict the intra-chain disulfide bond connectivity patterns starting from known cysteine bonding states with an evolutionary-based unsupervised approach called Sephiroth that relies on high-quality alignments obtained with HHblits and is based on a coarse-grained cluster-based modelization of tandem cysteine mutations within a protein family. We compared our method with state-of-the-art unsupervised predictors and achieve a performance improvement of 25-27% while requiring an order of magnitude less of aligned homologous sequences (∼10(3) instead of ∼10(4)). AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software described in this article and the datasets used are available at http://ibsquare.be/sephiroth. CONTACT: wvranken@vub.ac.be SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary material is available at Bioinformatics online.
22243679	Perceived weight gain, risk, and nutrition in pregnancy in five racial groups.	OBJECTIVE: Examine perceived pregnancy weight gain needed, perceived risks to mother, and infant of excessive weight and underweight, perceptions of actual, ideal, realistic body size, nutritional intake in five racial/ethnic groups. DESIGN: Cross-sectional Setting: Physicians' offices Participants: A total of 54 women <20 weeks gestation. METHODS: Questionnaires-perceived weight gain needed, risks of weight gain for mother, infant, perceptions of body size, food frequency. RESULTS: A total of 39% of women are overweight or obese (57% Caribbean Black, 50% African American). Perceived pregnancy weight gain needed highest in Central American Hispanic women, lowest Caribbean Black women. African-American women had low perceived risk for mother and infant of gaining too much pregnancy weight, highest perceived risk for both of gaining too little. Caribbean Black women perceived highest risk to mother of gaining too much pregnancy weight, highest risk to infant of gaining too little. White Non-Hispanic women reported smaller prepregnant, ideal, realistic body sizes than other four groups. Daily caloric intake ranged from 599 to 5856 calories. African-American women had significantly more calories; protein, total fats, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fats; carbohydrates, sugar; and iron than White Non-Hispanic women. Women in each racial/ethnic group had less than recommended intake of protein, carbohydrates, calcium, iron, folate, and fiber. CONCLUSIONS: Education is needed to raise awareness of risks of prepregnancy weight and excessive weight gain for mother and infant. The need for prenatal nutritional counseling to reduce the intake of calories, fats, sweets, and snacks; increase intake of vegetables, fruits, foods with iron, folate, and fiber.
26025871	'No Man׳s Land': An exploration of the traumatic experiences of student midwives in practice.	BACKGROUND: the role of being 'with woman' during traumatic birth has been identified as having an emotional cost for midwives, but to date no research has explored traumatic experiences of student midwives. AIM: to explore student midwives׳ perceptions of what was traumatic for them and how they were supported with such events. DESIGN: a qualitative descriptive approach, using semi structured interviews. SETTING: one university in the North West of England. PARTICIPANTS: 11 student midwives recruited by poster campaign. FINDINGS: five main themes emerged from the analysis. Wearing your Blues depicted what participants described as the 'bleak' landscape of practice. No Man's Land was concerned with traumatic tensions in the student role. 'Get the Red Box! ' and The Aftermath concerned traumatic events in practice and the impact of these on students. Learning to cope related to the way students coped with such incidents, as well as other stresses in the role. KEY CONCLUSIONS: the student midwife inhabits a vulnerable position in the 'No Man's Land' of hospital practice. Her strong identification with the woman renders her potentially more vulnerable in traumatic situations. The study revealed a paradigmatic clash between the manualised care of a busy obstetric unit and the individualised woman-led approach they were expecting. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: it seems important for the profession to recognise that distressing events are not always the obvious critical incidents in care, and that a culture of support and/or debriefing after adverse events may assist students to articulate their needs and develop resilience. Educators may need to appreciate that the student midwife role in an emergency may heighten her vulnerability. This study also highlighted the potential alienation of students when placed in the maelstrom of a busy obstetric unit. The Birthplace study (Brocklehurst et al., 2011), NHS England's Five Year Forward View (NHS England, 2014) and NICE (2014) all recommend increasing the numbers of out-of-hospital births: it seems likely that such a reorganisation of care would improve the experiences of mothers and those who care for them during birth. As part of a 'design for compassionate care' (Crawford et al., 2014) it is important to foster spaces, processes and resources which are compassionate to practitioners and students.
21597014	Intravenous thrombolysis in nonagenarians with ischemic stroke.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Demographic changes will result in a rapid increase of patients age ≥90 years (nonagenarians), but little is known about outcomes in these patients after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke. We aimed to assess safety and functional outcome in nonagenarians treated with IVT and to compare the outcomes with those of patients age 80 to 89 years (octogenarians). METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data of 284 consecutive stroke patients age ≥80 years treated with IVT in 7 Swiss stroke units. Presenting characteristics, favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0 or 1), mortality at 3 months, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST) criteria were compared between nonagenarians and octogenarians. RESULTS: As compared with octogenarians (n=238; mean age, 83 years), nonagenarians (n=46; mean age, 92 years) were more often women (70% versus 54%; P=0.046) and had lower systolic blood pressure (161 mm Hg versus 172 mm Hg; P=0.035). Patients age ≥90 years less often had a favorable outcome and had a higher incidence of mortality than did patients age 80 to 89 years (14.3% versus 30.2%; P=0.034; and 45.2% versus 22.1%; P=0.002; respectively), while more nonagenarians than octogenarians experienced a SICH (SICH(NINDS), 13.3% versus 5.9%; P=0.106; SICH(SITS-MOST), 13.3% versus 4.7%; P=0.037). Multivariate adjustment identified age ≥90 years as an independent predictor of mortality (P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests less favorable outcomes in nonagenarians as compared with octogenarians after IVT for ischemic stroke, and it demands a careful selection for treatment, unless randomized controlled trials yield more evidence for IVT in very old stroke patients.
22700496	Comparative evaluation of air cell and eggshell temperature measurement methodologies used in broiler hatching eggs during late incubation.	The current study was conducted to compare and contrast the uses of 2 devices (temperature transponder or infrared thermometer) and their locations (inner air cell membrane or outer eggshell surface) in Ross × Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs. The air cells of 14 embryonated and 10 nonembryonated eggs were implanted with temperature transponders on d 13.5 of incubation. Likewise, for these same eggs, eggshell surface temperature was detected with the use of transponders and an infrared thermometer. Temperatures were recorded every 12 h between 14.5 and 18 d of incubation, and graphs and corresponding regression values were used to track the temperatures over these time periods. The temperature readings using all methods in embryonated and nonembryonated eggs were positively correlated. In nonembryonated eggs, temperatures in the air cell and on the eggshell surface using transponders were higher than those on the eggshell surface using an infrared thermometer. Mean air cell temperature readings of embryonated eggs using transponders were higher than those of the eggshell, as determined with the use of transponders or an infrared thermometer. Furthermore, the differences in air cell temperature using transponders and eggshell temperature using an infrared thermometer in embryonated eggs increased with embryonic age. These readings confirmed increased embryo heat production during the incubational period examined. It was further concluded that when compared with actual embryo body temperatures determined in previous studies, the use of transponders in the air cells of broiler hatching eggs detected a higher and closer temperature than eggshell surface temperature. It is suggested that the air cell transponders in embryonated eggs circumvented the confounding effects of the thermal barrier properties of the eggshell and the flow of air across its surface.
25574680	Assessment tool for total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a Delphi consensus survey among international experts.	OBJECTIVE:  To achieve consensus among experts on the essentials steps to include in an assessment tool for total laparoscopic hysterectomy.  METHODS:  Using a Delphi consensus process, an initial survey was created based on the current literature and local expertise in laparoscopic surgery and sent to international experts in laparoscopic gynaecology. Experts were selected according to specific criteria. A second survey was formulated based on the answers and comments from the first round and sent to all experts who participated in the first round. Consensus was defined as a Cronbach alpha ≥ 0.80. A rate of agreement ≥ 0.70 was used to define which substeps to keep in the final tool. RESULTS:  From the 85 experts invited to participate, 53 (62%) agreed to participate, and 51 of these participated in both rounds. The final instrument to assess total laparoscopic hysterectomy was created using the items with a high level of agreement after two rounds. This final tool showed good internal consistency among the experts, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.90. CONCLUSION:  Using a Delphi methodology, we achieved international consensus among experts in laparoscopic gynaecology within a short time frame and with minimal costs. The resulting evaluation tool for total laparoscopic hysterectomy may serve in the assessment of surgical skills in the future, and would be a valuable adjunct to postgraduate training and continuing medical education programs. This tool will now undergo a validation process, comparing the rating scores of novices and experts surgeons.
29467745	Small Non-coding RNA RyhB Mediates Persistence to Multiple Antibiotics and Stresses in Uropathogenic Escherichia coli by Reducing Cellular Metabolism.	As dormant phenotypic variants of bacteria, persisters account for many chronic infections affecting human health. Despite numerous studies, the role of small non-coding RNA (sRNA) in bacterial persistence has not been reported. To investigate the role of Hfq-interacting sRNA in persistence, we constructed the deletion mutants of 20 Hfq-interacting sRNAs (RyhB, GcvB, MgrR, RybB, MicF, SgrS, RprA, DicF, SsrS, FnrS, GadY, DsrA, OmrB, ArcZ, RyeB, RydC, OmrA, MicA, MicC, and ChiX) to assess their persistence capacity in uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain UTI89 and identified a new sRNA RyhB being involved in persister formation. The ryhB-knockout mutant had significant defect in persistence to a diverse range of antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefotaxime, gentamicin) and stresses (hyperosmosis, acid, and heat) in both exponential phase and stationary phase. In addition, the effect of RyhB on persistence was synergistic with ppGpp and Fur protein. RNA-Seq analysis indicated that the ryhB-knockout mutant had a hyperactive metabolic state compared with the parent strain. Interestingly, increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and altered NAD+/NADH ratios were observed in the ryhB-knockout mutant. Our findings represent a new level of persistence regulation via sRNA and may provide novel therapeutic targets for interventions.
22956999	Complex structure of engineered modular domains defining molecular interaction between ICAM-1 and integrin LFA-1.	Intermolecular contacts between integrin LFA-1 (α(L)β(2)) and ICAM-1 derive solely from the integrin α(L) I domain and the first domain (D1) of ICAM-1. This study presents a crystal structure of the engineered complex of the α(L) I domain and ICAM-1 D1. Previously, we engineered the I domain for high affinity by point mutations that were identified by a directed evolution approach. In order to examine α(L) I domain allostery between the C-terminal α7-helix (allosteric site) and the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (active site), we have chosen a high affinity variant without mutations directly influencing either the position of the α7-helix or the active sites. In our crystal, the α(L) I domain was found to have a high affinity conformation to D1 with its α7-helix displaced downward away from the binding interface, recapitulating a current understanding of the allostery in the I domain and its linkage to neighboring domains of integrins in signaling. To enable soluble D1 of ICAM-1 to fold on its own, we also engineered D1 to be functional by mutations, which were found to be those that would convert hydrogen bond networks in the solvent-excluded core into vdW contacts. The backbone structure of the β-sandwich fold and the epitope for I domain binding of the engineered D1 were essentially identical to those of wild-type D1. Most deviations in engineered D1 were found in the loops at the N-terminal region that interacts with human rhinovirus (HRV). Structural deviation found in engineered D1 was overall in agreement with the function of engineered D1 observed previously, i.e., full capacity binding to α(L) I domain but reduced interaction with HRV.
29191227	Performance of MTBDRplus assay in detecting multidrug resistant tuberculosis at hospital level.	OBJECTIVE: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) case finding progressively increased in Ethiopia mainly as a result of the utilization of World Health Organization (WHO)-endorsed rapid technologies including MTBDRplus assay. However, there is inadequate data on routine testing performance of the MTBDRplus assay. Consequently, the aim of the study was to assess the routine performance of the MTBDRplus assay in detecting MDR-TB at St. Peter's TB Specialized Hospital. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRplus in detecting isoniazid (INH) resistance were 96.3 and 100%, respectively. While for rifampicin (RIF) 100% was recorded for both. Similarly, a sensitivity of 97.96% and a specificity of 100% was measured for detecting MDR-TB. Among 49 MTBDRplus RIF resistant isolates, 46 (93.9%) strains had rpoB mutation. S531L was the most common rpoB mutant (81.6% of RIF resistant cases). All MTBDRplus INH resistant isolates (n = 52) had S315T1 katG mutation.
26519046	Effectiveness of a transdiagnostic internet-based protocol for the treatment of emotional disorders versus treatment as usual in specialized care: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Emotional disorders (depression and anxiety disorders) are highly prevalent mental health problems. Although evidence showing the effectiveness of disorder-specific treatments exists, high comorbidity rates among emotional disorders limit the utility of these protocols. This has led some researchers to focus their interest on transdiagnostic interventions, a treatment perspective that might be more widely effective across these disorders. Also, the current way of delivering treatments makes it difficult provide assistance to all of the population in need. The use of the Internet in the delivery of evidence-based treatments may help to disseminate treatments among the population. In this study, we aim to test the effectiveness of EmotionRegulation, a new transdiagnostic Internet-based protocol for unipolar mood disorders, five anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified), and obsessive-compulsive disorder in comparison to treatment as usual as provided in Spanish public specialized mental health care. We will also study its potential impact on basic temperament dimensions (neuroticism/behavioral inhibition and extraversion/behavioral activation). Expectations and opinions of patients about this protocol will also be studied. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomized controlled trial. 200 participants recruited in specialized care will be allocated to one of two treatment conditions: a) EmotionRegulation or b) treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures will be the BAI and the BDI-II. Secondary outcomes will include a specific measure of the principal disorder, and measures of neuroticism/behavioral inhibition and extraversion/behavioral activation. Patients will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3- and 12-month follow-ups. Intention to treat and per protocol analyses will be performed. DISCUSSION: Although the effectiveness of face-to-face transdiagnostic protocols has been investigated in previous studies, the number of published transdiagnostic Internet-based programs is still quite low. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial studying the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic Internet-based treatment for several emotional disorders in public specialized care. Combining both a transdiagnostic approach with an Internet-based therapy format may help to decrease the burden of mental disorders, reducing the difficulties associated with disorder-specific treatments and facilitating access to people in need of treatment. Strengths and limitations are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02345668 . Registered 27 July 2015.
27084507	Azacitidine front-line in 339 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia: comparison of French-American-British and World Health Organization classifications.	BACKGROUND: The MDS-IWG and NCCN currently endorse both FAB and WHO classifications of MDS and AML, thus allowing patients with 20-30 % bone marrow blasts (AML20-30, formerly MDS-RAEB-t) to be categorised and treated as either MDS or AML. In addition, an artificial distinction between AML20-30 and AML30+ was made by regulatory agencies by initially restricting approval of azacitidine to AML20-30. Thus, uncertainty prevails regarding the diagnosis, prognosis and optimal treatment timing and strategy for patients with AML20-30. Here, we aim to provide clarification for patients treated with azacitidine front-line. METHODS: The Austrian Azacitidine Registry is a multicentre database (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01595295). For this analysis, we selected 339 patients treated with azacitidine front-line. According to the WHO classification 53, 96 and 190 patients had MDS-RAEB-I, MDS-RAEB-II and AML (AML20-30: n = 79; AML30+: n = 111), respectively. According to the FAB classification, 131, 101 and 111 patients had MDS-RAEB, MDS-RAEB-t and AML, respectively. RESULTS: The median ages of patients with MDS and AML were 72 (range 37-87) and 77 (range 23-93) years, respectively. Overall, 80 % of classifiable patients (≤30 % bone marrow blasts) had intermediate-2 or high-risk IPSS scores. Most other baseline, treatment and response characteristics were similar between patients diagnosed with MDS or AML. WHO-classified patients with AML20-30 had significantly worse OS than patients with MDS-RAEB-II (13.1 vs 18.9 months; p = 0.010), but similar OS to patients with AML30+ (10.9 vs 13.1 months; p = 0.238). AML patients that showed MDS-related features did not have worse outcomes compared with patients who did not (13.2 vs 8.9 months; p = 0.104). FAB-classified patients with MDS-RAEB-t had similar survival to patients with AML30+ (12.8 vs 10.9 months; p = 0.376), but significantly worse OS than patients with MDS-RAEB (10.9 vs 24.4 months; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the validity of the WHO classification of MDS and AML, and its superiority over the former FAB classification, for patients treated with azacitidine front-line. Neither bone marrow blast count nor presence of MDS-related features had an adverse prognostic impact on survival. Patients with AML20-30 should therefore be regarded as having 'true AML' and in our opinion treatment should be initiated without delay.
26699268	Protein intrinsic disorder within the Potyvirus genus: from proteome-wide analysis to functional annotation.	Within proteins, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are devoid of stable secondary and tertiary structures under physiological conditions and rather exist as dynamic ensembles of inter-converting conformers. Although ubiquitous in all domains of life, the intrinsic disorder content is highly variable in viral genomes. Over the years, functional annotations of disordered regions at the scale of the whole proteome have been conducted for several animal viruses. But to date, similar studies applied to plant viruses are still missing. Based on disorder prediction tools combined with annotation programs and evolutionary studies, we analyzed the intrinsic disorder content in Potyvirus, using a 10-species dataset representative of this genus diversity. In this paper, we revealed that: (i) the Potyvirus proteome displays high disorder content, (ii) disorder is conserved during Potyvirus evolution, suggesting a functional advantage of IDRs, (iii) IDRs evolve faster than ordered regions, and (iv) IDRs may be associated with major biological functions required for the Potyvirus cycle. Notably, the proteins P1, Coat protein (CP) and Viral genome-linked protein (VPg) display a high content of conserved disorder, enriched in specific motifs mimicking eukaryotic functional modules and suggesting strategies of host machinery hijacking. In these three proteins, IDRs are particularly conserved despite their high amino acid polymorphism, indicating a link to adaptive processes. Through this comprehensive study, we further investigate the biological relevance of intrinsic disorder in Potyvirus biology and we propose a functional annotation of potyviral proteome IDRs.
23241812	Nodular Basal cell carcinoma arising in a split-thickness skin graft of the scalp.	We present the first known case of basal cell carcinoma arising in a split-thickness skin graft in the United States. The apparent low incidence of basal cell carcinoma in split-thickness skin graft attests to its unique environment and could possibly be attributed to the following: (1) the donor sites for split-thickness skin grafts are usually areas that are not subjected to heavy sun exposure; (2) individuals with skin grafts may not live as long on average, or their skin grafts may be subsequently excised with further reconstructive procedures; and (3) cases may be underreported. Because basal cell carcinomas have a fairly benign course, many patients either do not present to a physician or are not reported. This case shows that a split-thickness skin graft can have an adequate microenvironment for the development of basal cell carcinoma.
24381439	Arsenic-induced oxidative stress in the common bean legume, Phaseolus vulgaris L. seedlings and its amelioration by exogenous nitric oxide.	The adverse effects of arsenic (As) toxicity on seedling growth, root and shoot anatomy, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, root oxidizability (RO), antioxidant enzyme activities, H2O2 content, lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage (EL%) in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were investigated. The role of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) in amelioration of As-induced inhibitory effect was also evaluated using sodium nitroprusside (100 μM SNP) as NO donor and 2-(4-carboxy-2-phenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (200 μM PTIO) as NO scavenger in different combinations with 50 μM As. As-induced growth inhibition was associated with marked anomalies in anatomical features, reduction in pigment composition, increased RO and severe perturbations in antioxidant enzyme activities. While activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase increased, levels of ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione reductase decreased significantly and guaiacol peroxidase remained normal. The over-accumulation of H2O2 content along with high level of lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage indicates As-induced oxidative damage in P. vulgaris seedlings with more pronounced effect on the roots than the shoots. Exogenous addition of NO significantly reversed the As-induced oxidative stress, maintaining H2O2 in a certain level through balanced alterations of antioxidant enzyme activities. The role of NO in the process of amelioration has ultimately been manifested by significant reduction of membrane damage and improvement of growth performance in plants grown on As + SNP media. Onset of oxidative stress was more severe after addition of PTIO, which confirms the protective role of NO against As-induced oxidative damage in P. vulgaris seedlings.
21287131	Transcriptional and Posttranscriptional Programming by Long Noncoding RNAs.	Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that noncoding RNAs, which include both small and long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), contribute to a significant portion of the transcriptome in eukaryotic organisms. However, the functional significance of this wide-spread occurrence of ncRNAs, and in particular, the long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), for organismal development and differentiation is unclear. The available evidence from a subset of lncRNAs suggests that certain lncRNAs, and/or the act of their transcription, are involved in important biological functions at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. This chapter discusses the epigenetic and nonepigenetic mechanisms by which lncRNAs and/or their transcription are involved in the programming of various biological functions in model systems, from yeast to mammals.
18414209	Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 1176 consecutive clinical genetics investigations.	PURPOSE: Cytogenetic investigations are useful for etiologic determinations of mental retardation, developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies, and pregnancy complications; however, the causes remain elusive in a majority of cases despite high-resolution cytogenetic studies and multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization examinations. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization has the ability to examine the genome at a higher resolution and may yield an increased detection of genetic abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization in a clinical genetics setting. METHODS: DNA from 1176 patients was analyzed using a bacterial artificial chromosome array-based comparative genomic hybridization platform. All abnormal cases were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and parental studies were completed when possible. RESULTS: Of the 1176 patients included in this survey, 163 showed a genomic imbalance identified by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Of these 163 cases, 116 had a clinically relevant genetic abnormality. A total of 9.8% (116 of 1176 cases) were determined to exhibit a causative genomic imbalance. Twenty-five of the 116 abnormal cases had a previously identified cytogenetic abnormality yielding an increased detection rate of 7.9% (91 of 1146) in cases with normal or no cytogenetics. CONCLUSION: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization increases the overall abnormality detection rate, thus improving the diagnostic potential of clinical cytogenetics investigations.
21598686	[DNA repeated sequences may be involved in the synaptonemal complexes formation].	Synatonemal complexes (SCs) are the intranuclear structures which facilitate reversible lateral synapsis of the homologous chromosomes in the course of meiosis. It is still unclear which DNA nucleotide sequences are responsible for the chromatin attachment to the SC lateral elements. Considering the features of the dispersed repeated sequences (RS) it is worth to assume their participation in the structure functional organization of the meiotic chromosome. Using numerical analysis we have investigated the relationship between RS and the distribution of events of the meiotic recombination in mouse chromosome 1. Using in situ hybridization on spread mouse spermatocytes, we have demonstrated the arrangement of different types of RS relative to SCs. Hybridization signals of B1(Alu), B2, and minisatellite probes were localizating predominantly in the SCs regions. Our results allow us to suggest the model of the meiotic chromosome organization with the RS as the sequences, participating in the attachment of chromatin loops and SCs.
29192088	Complete Genome Sequence of Bacillus altitudinis P-10, a Potential Bioprotectant against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Isolated from Rice Rhizosphere in Java, Indonesia.	Bacillus altitudinis P-10 was isolated from the rhizosphere of rice grown in an organic rice field and provides strong antagonism against the bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice. Herein, we provide the complete genome sequence and a possible explanation of the antibiotic function of the P-10 strain.
28011868	Chemical-Induced Inhibition of Blue Light-Mediated Seedling Development Caused by Disruption of Upstream Signal Transduction Involving Cryptochromes in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Plants have a remarkable ability to perceive and respond to various wavelengths of light and initiate regulation of different cascades of light signaling and molecular components. While the perception of red light and the mechanisms of its signaling involving phytochromes are largely known, knowledge of the mechanisms of blue light signaling is still limited. Chemical genetics involves the use of diverse small active or synthetic molecules to evaluate biological processes. By combining chemicals and analyzing the effects they have on plant morphology, we identified a chemical, 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole (3B7N), that promotes hypocotyl elongation of wild-type Arabidopsis only under continuous blue light. Further evaluation with loss-of-function mutants confirmed that 3B7N inhibits photomorphogenesis through cryptochrome-mediated light signaling. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the effect of 3B7N treatment on gene expression in cry1cry2 is considerably smaller than that in the wild type, indicating that 3B7N specifically interrupts cryptochrome function in the control of seedling development in a light-dependent manner. We demonstrated that 3B7N directly binds to CRY1 protein using an in vitro binding assay. These results suggest that 3B7N is a novel chemical that directly inhibits plant cryptochrome function by physical binding. The application of 3B7N can be used on other plants to study further the blue light mechanism and the genetic control of cryptochromes in the growth and development of plant species.
24617672	Students' perception of case-based continuous assessment and multiple-choice assessment in a small animal surgery course for veterinary medical students.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between students' perceptions of 2 assessment methods and academic performance. STUDY DESIGN: A 2-year prospective survey study in a 4-year Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) curriculum. SAMPLE POPULATION: Year 3 DVM students (n = 44). METHODS: An assessment of learning gain questionnaire was used to investigate students' perceptions regarding multiple-choice examination (MCE) versus take-home case-based continuous assessment (CA) in a 3rd year small animal surgery lecture course. Academic performance and student assessment of learning gain in the 2 course components were compared. Relationships between student perceptions and academic performance were examined. A follow-up survey was conducted during clinical rotations in 4th year to determine change in student perceptions over time. RESULTS: Academic performance in 3rd year was significantly enhanced by use of CA, particularly for students with weaker grades. Academic performance in 4th year clinical rotations was not closely related to 3rd year performance. Many students preferred an instructional approach with provision of comprehensive notes and assessment with multiple-choice questions based on the notes. However, students recognized that feedback on work submitted for CA grading significantly facilitated learning. Student assessment of learning gain was correlated with academic performance in the 3rd year course component examined by CA, but not the component assessed using MCE. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that perceptions of learning gain, academic accomplishment, and clinical performance in 4th year are weakly correlated. Teachers should better explain to veterinary students that learning to be a clinician is more than replication of knowledge.
23912560	Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and bone: is there a relationship in humans?	UNLABELLED: In animals, high fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) states improve insulin resistance but induce bone loss. Whether FGF21 relates to bone mineral density (BMD) is unknown in humans. Contrary to prediction from animal findings, we found higher FGF21 levels associating with greater BMD in women, independent of age and body composition. INTRODUCTION: Recent laboratory studies suggest that FGF21 is involved in reciprocal regulation of bone and energy homeostasis. Systemic administration of FGF21 protects animals from obesity and diabetes but causes severe bone loss, smothering the enthusiasm over FGF21 as a potential antiobesity therapeutic. To date, there is no information on whether FGF21 relates to BMD in humans. We thus studied the relationship between plasma FGF21 levels and BMD in healthy adults. METHODS: Fasting plasma FGF21 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Among 40 healthy volunteers (age 32 ± 10 year, 16 women), men had significantly higher lean body mass (p < 0.01) and total BMD (p < 0.05), and lower percent body fat than women (p < 0.01). Median plasma FGF21 levels were not different between the sexes. While there was no association between FGF21 concentrations and body composition in men, FGF21 levels correlated positively with fat mass (p < 0.01) in women. In men, no significant correlation between FGF21 with BMD was observed. However, in women, FGF21 correlated positively with total BMD (R (2) = 0.69, p = 0.003) and spine BMD (R (2) = 0.76, p = 0.001); the correlation remained significant after adjusting for age, ethnicity, and body composition. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals for the first time a strong positive association between plasma FGF21 levels and BMD in healthy women, suggesting the association between bone loss and high FGF21 states in animals may not be directly translated to humans in physiologic states. We hypothesize that FGF21 may increase bone mass particularly in women through paracrine mechanisms in the bone-adipose interface.
19572152	Specificity of odorant-binding proteins: a factor influencing the sensitivity of olfactory receptor-based biosensors.	Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) primarily function in the transport of hydrophobic odorants. In this study, OBPs originating from rat and pig were cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3, and expressed in HEK-293 cells, and their specificity for odorants and olfactory receptors was examined. Results suggest that OBPs have a high affinity for the olfactory receptors when both the OBP and receptor originate from the same species. The rat OBPs were bound not only to the rat olfactory receptor I7 but also to the odorant specific to I7. The solubility of the odorant was increased by both OBP2 and OBP3, which originate from rat, but with different efficiencies. These results demonstrate that OBPs specifically interact with odorants as well as olfactory receptors, and these interactions can influence the sensitivity of olfactory receptor-based biosensors.
18754079	Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance.	CBF/DREB (C-repeat binding factor/dehydration responsive element binding factor) family of transcription factors in plants is reported to be associated with regulation of gene expression under stress conditions. Here, we report the functional characterization of a DREB transcription factor, DREB1B gene from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica). The OsDREB1B gene was differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salicylic acid, ABA, and cold. A 745 bp promoter region of OsDREB1B cDNA was fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and introduced via Agrobacterium tumifaciens into the genome of Arabidopsis. Histochemical analysis of GUS expression in T(2) transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that OsDREB1B shows stress-specific induction pattern in response to a variety of stresses like mannitol, NaCl, PEG, methyl viologen, cold, ABA, and salicylic acid. Leaf-order-dependent induction pattern of the promoter was observed in response to both cold and ABA stresses. Further, OsDREB1B cDNA was introduced into tobacco plants under the control of CaMV35S promoter to investigate the role of DREB1B product in plant stress response. Transgenic tobacco plants have shown improved seed germination, root growth, membrane stability, and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-pycrilhydrazil hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity under inhibitory concentrations of mannitol. Importantly, transgenic plants accumulated higher fresh weight under long-term osmotic stress, and also have shown retention of more water than the wild type during drought stress. Overexpression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also improved the oxidative and freezing stress tolerance of transgenic plants. In addition, tobacco plants constitutively expressing OsDREB1B have shown decreased sensitivity to tobacco streak virus infection. Constitutive expression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also induced the expression of PR genes in transgenic plants. The data obtained provide strong in vivo evidence that OsDREB1B is involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses, and confers broad-spectrum stress tolerance to transgenic plants.
26955634	Rearing Laying Hens in Aviaries Reduces Fearfulness following Transfer to Furnished Cages.	Appropriate rearing is essential for ensuring the welfare and productivity of laying hens. Early experience has the potential to affect the development of fearfulness. This study tested whether rearing in aviaries, as opposed to cages, reduces the fearfulness of laying hens after transfer to furnished cages. Fear responses were recorded as avoidance of a novel object in the home cage. Lohmann Selected Leghorns were reared in an aviary system or conventional rearing cages and then transported to furnished cages at 16 weeks, before the onset of lay. Observations of a selection of birds were conducted at 19 (N = 50 independent cages) and 21 (N = 48 independent cages) weeks of age. At 19 and 21 weeks, cage-reared birds showed higher levels of fearfulness indicated by spending more time away from the novel object compared to aviary-reared birds. These results suggest that rearing in an enriched aviary environment reduces fearfulness up to the fifth week after transfer to a new housing system, compared to rearing in cages.
29745152	[Effects of controlled release blend bulk urea on soil nitrogen and soil enzyme activity in wheat and rice fields].	A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) combined with urea (UR) on the soil fertility and environment in wheat-rice rotation system. Changes in four forms of nitrogen (total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and microbial biomass nitrogen) and in activities of three soil enzymes participating in nitrogen transformation (urease, protease, and nitrate reductase) were measured in seven fertilization treatments (no fertilization, routine fertilization, 10%CRF+90%UR, 20%CRF+80%UR, 40%CRF+60%UR, 80%CRF+20%UR, and 100%CRF). The results showed that soil total nitrogen was stable in the whole growth period of wheat and rice. There was no significant difference among the treatments of over 20% CRF in soil total nitrogen content of wheat and rice. The soil inorganic nitrogen content was increased dramatically in treatments of 40% or above CRF during the mid-late growing stages of wheat and rice. With the advance of the growth period, conventional fertilization significantly decreased soil microbial biomass nitrogen, but the treatments of 40% and above CRF increased the soil microbial biomass nitrogen significantly. The soil enzyme activities were increased with over 40% of CRF in the mid-late growing stage of wheat and rice. By increasing the CRF ratio, the soil protease activity and nitrate reductase activity were improved gradually, and peaked in 100% CRF. The treatments of above 20% CRF could decrease the urease activity in tillering stage of rice and delay the peak of ammonium nitrogen, which would benefit nitrogen loss reduction. The treatments of 40% and above CRF were beneficial to improving soil nitrogen supply and enhancing soil urease and protease activities, which could promote the effectiveness of nitrogen during the later growth stages of wheat and rice. The 100% CRF treatment improved the nitrate reductase activity significantly during the later stage of wheat and rice. Compared with the treatments of 40%-80% CRF, 100% CRF reduced the soil nitrate content of 20-40 cm soil layer in wheat significantly suggesting it could reduce the loss of nitrogen.
26873689	Percutaneous Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Closure in Very Preterm Infants: Feasibility and Complications.	BACKGROUND: Percutaneous closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in term neonates is established, but data regarding outcomes in infants born very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation) are minimal, and no published criteria exist establishing a minimal weight of 4 kg as a suitable cutoff. We sought to analyze outcomes of percutaneous PDA occlusion in infants born very preterm and referred for PDA closure at weights <4 kg. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective analysis (January 2005-January 2014) was done at a single pediatric center. Procedural successes and adverse events were recorded. Markers of respiratory status (need for mechanical ventilation) were determined, with comparisons made before and after catheterization. A total of 52 very preterm infants with a median procedural weight of 2.9 kg (range 1.2-3.9 kg) underwent attempted PDA closure. Twenty-five percent (13/52) of infants were <2.5 kg. Successful device placement was achieved in 46/52 (88%) of infants. An adverse event occurred in 33% of cases, with an acute arterial injury the most common complication. We observed no association between weight at time of procedure and the risk of an adverse event. No deaths were attributable to the PDA closure. Compared to precatheterization trends, percutaneous PDA closure resulted in improved respiratory status, including less exposure to mechanical ventilation (mixed effects logistic model, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among infants born very preterm, percutaneous PDA closure at weights <4 kg is generally safe and may improve respiratory health, but risk of arterial injury is noteworthy. Randomized clinical trials are needed to assess clinically relevant differences in outcomes following percutaneous PDA closure versus alternative (surgical ligation) management strategies.
29267332	Construction of an SNP-based high-density linkage map for flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology.	Flax is an important crop for oil and fiber, however, no high-density genetic maps have been reported for this species. Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a high-resolution strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In this study, SLAF-seq was employed to develop SNP markers in an F2 population to construct a high-density genetic map for flax. In total, 196.29 million paired-end reads were obtained. The average sequencing depth was 25.08 in male parent, 32.17 in the female parent, and 9.64 in each F2 progeny. In total, 389,288 polymorphic SLAFs were detected, from which 260,380 polymorphic SNPs were developed. After filtering, 4,638 SNPs were found suitable for genetic map construction. The final genetic map included 4,145 SNP markers on 15 linkage groups and was 2,632.94 cM in length, with an average distance of 0.64 cM between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map is the densest SNP-based genetic map for flax. The SNP markers and genetic map reported in here will serve as a foundation for the fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), map-based gene cloning and marker assisted selection (MAS) for flax.
19808145	Prevalence of the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications at ambulatory care visits by elderly patients covered by the Taiwanese National Health Insurance program.	BACKGROUND: The use of potentially inappropriate medications can have profound medical consequences for elderly patients and place a substantial burden on the health care system. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication prescribing at ambulatory care visits by patients aged > or =65 years covered by the Taiwanese National Health Insurance program, to examine the characteristics of and risk factors for such prescribing, and to investigate its influence on health care resource utilization. METHODS: Ambulatory care visits by patients aged > or =65 years in 2001-2004 were identified from the National Health Insurance claims database. The 2003 Beers criteria for drugs to be avoided in the elderly were used to identify potentially inappropriate medications prescribed at these visits. Only drugs with the potential to lead to higher-severity adverse events were included. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications at ambulatory care visits. Independent variables in the regression model included patient characteristics (eg, sex, age), physician characteristics (sex, age, and specialty), and visit characteristics (site and prescribed drug number). The dependent variable was visits that included a prescription for a potentially inappropriate medication. RESULTS: Overall, 176,661,994 ambulatory care visits by patients aged > or =65 years were identified in 2001-2004. Of these, 19.1% involved a prescription for a potentially inappropriate medication. Although the frequency of potentially inappropriate medication prescribing declined over the study period, 62.5% of elderly patients were exposed to such medications in 2004. The only patient characteristic associated with an increased likelihood of the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications was female sex (male sex: odds ratio [OR] = 0.982 [95% CI, 0.980-0.983], P < 0.001). Physician characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications was male sex (OR = 1.206 [95% CI, 1.202-1.210], P < 0.001); older age (43-50 years: OR = 1.021 [95% CI, 1.018-1.025], P < 0.001; >/=51 years: OR = 1.238 [95% CI, 1.235-1.242], P < 0.001); and family medicine/general practice (OR = 1.267 [95% CI, 1.265-1.269], P < 0.001). For visit characteristics, significant associations were found with visits to a primary care clinic (OR = 1.887 [95% CI, 1.881-1.892], P < 0.001) and the number of drugs prescribed (4-6 drugs: OR = 2.701 [95% CI, 2.696-2.706], P < 0.001; > or =7 drugs: OR = 4.528 [95% CI, 4.517-4.538], P < 0.001). The most commonly prescribed types of potentially inappropriate medications were antihistamines (4.8% of all prescriptions in 48.3% of elderly patients), muscle relaxants/antispasmodics (4.0% and 40.3%, respectively), and long-acting benzodiazepines (2.4% and 21.4%). In 2004, the mean number of ambulatory care visits per patient was significantly higher among those who received potentially inappropriate medications compared with those who did not (30.78 vs 16.57, respectively; P < 0.001). Patients who received potentially inappropriate medications also had significantly more emergency department visits (0.27 vs 0.15; P < 0.001) and hospital admissions (0.46 vs 0.27; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a high prevalence of the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications at ambulatory care visits by elderly patients in Taiwan in 2001-2004.
18665266	Climate change and local public health in the United States: preparedness, programs and perceptions of local public health department directors.	While climate change is inherently a global problem, its public health impacts will be experienced most acutely at the local and regional level, with some jurisdictions likely to be more burdened than others. The public health infrastructure in the U.S. is organized largely as an interlocking set of public agencies at the federal, state and local level, with lead responsibility for each city or county often residing at the local level. To understand how directors of local public health departments view and are responding to climate change as a public health issue, we conducted a telephone survey with 133 randomly selected local health department directors, representing a 61% response rate. A majority of respondents perceived climate change to be a problem in their jurisdiction, a problem they viewed as likely to become more common or severe over the next 20 years. Only a small minority of respondents, however, had yet made climate change adaptation or prevention a top priority for their health department. This discrepancy between problem recognition and programmatic responses may be due, in part, to several factors: most respondents felt personnel in their health department--and other key stakeholders in their community--had a lack of knowledge about climate change; relatively few respondents felt their own health department, their state health department, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had the necessary expertise to help them create an effective mitigation or adaptation plan for their jurisdiction; and most respondents felt that their health department needed additional funding, staff and staff training to respond effectively to climate change. These data make clear that climate change adaptation and prevention are not currently major activities at most health departments, and that most, if not all, local health departments will require assistance in making this transition. We conclude by making the case that, through their words and actions, local health departments and their staff can and should play a role in alerting members of their community about the prospect of public health impacts from climate change in their jurisdiction.
22435897	Quantitative genome re-sequencing defines multiple mutations conferring chloroquine resistance in rodent malaria.	BACKGROUND: Drug resistance in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum severely compromises the treatment and control of malaria. A knowledge of the critical mutations conferring resistance to particular drugs is important in understanding modes of drug action and mechanisms of resistances. They are required to design better therapies and limit drug resistance.A mutation in the gene (pfcrt) encoding a membrane transporter has been identified as a principal determinant of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum, but we lack a full account of higher level chloroquine resistance. Furthermore, the determinants of resistance in the other major human malaria parasite, P. vivax, are not known. To address these questions, we investigated the genetic basis of chloroquine resistance in an isogenic lineage of rodent malaria parasite P. chabaudi in which high level resistance to chloroquine has been progressively selected under laboratory conditions. RESULTS: Loci containing the critical genes were mapped by Linkage Group Selection, using a genetic cross between the high-level chloroquine-resistant mutant and a genetically distinct sensitive strain. A novel high-resolution quantitative whole-genome re-sequencing approach was used to reveal three regions of selection on chr11, chr03 and chr02 that appear progressively at increasing drug doses on three chromosomes. Whole-genome sequencing of the chloroquine-resistant parent identified just four point mutations in different genes on these chromosomes. Three mutations are located at the foci of the selection valleys and are therefore predicted to confer different levels of chloroquine resistance. The critical mutation conferring the first level of chloroquine resistance is found in aat1, a putative aminoacid transporter. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative trait loci conferring selectable phenotypes, such as drug resistance, can be mapped directly using progressive genome-wide linkage group selection. Quantitative genome-wide short-read genome resequencing can be used to reveal these signatures of drug selection at high resolution. The identities of three genes (and mutations within them) conferring different levels of chloroquine resistance generate insights regarding the genetic architecture and mechanisms of resistance to chloroquine and other drugs. Importantly, their orthologues may now be evaluated for critical or accessory roles in chloroquine resistance in human malarias P. vivax and P. falciparum.
19261315	Quantification of dengue virus type 3 RNA in fatal and non-fatal cases in Brazil, 2002.	We examined levels of dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) RNA in association with the type of infection (primary or secondary) in 42 patients with fatal and non-fatal outcomes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2002. Subjects with fatal outcomes had mean virus titers significantly higher than those who survived (12.5 vs. 7.9 log(10) RNA copies/ml). Because primary infections were confirmed among the fatal cases (52.1%), antibody-dependent enhancement alone did not explain all the cases of severe disease in this study population. These findings suggest that high levels of DENV-3 may have contributed to the severe form of dengue in Rio de Janeiro, 2002.
29126048	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in adulthood: Long-term clinical follow-up of 38 patients and analysis of their recorded seizures.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy with childhood onset that usually continues through adolescence and into adulthood. In the long term, patients with this condition still have intractable seizures, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and physical comorbidities. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and EEG characteristics of a group of adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We identified 38 (22 females, 16 males) patients with LGS older than age 18years at their last evaluation, with mean age of 43.3±10.6years. Median follow-up was 14.4years (range: 2-40). All of our patients had 3 or more seizure types during their clinical history. The most prevalent seizure types at follow-up were atypical absences (28/38), tonic (28/38), generalized tonic-clonic (17/38), focal (11/38), and myoclonic seizures (9/38). All patients had drug-resistant seizures. Besides epilepsy, intellectual disability and behavioral problems were prominent features. Surprisingly, paroxysmal nonepileptic seizures were reported in 3 patients. Our observations confirm the poor outcome of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome through adulthood, regardless of age at seizure onset, etiology, and history of previous West syndrome.
25017127	The Vicious Worm: a computer-based Taenia solium education tool.	Ignorance is a major obstacle for the effective control of diseases. To provide evidence-based knowledge about prevention and control of Taenia solium cysticercosis, we have developed a computer-based education tool: 'The Vicious Worm'. The tool targets policy makers, professionals, and laypeople, and comprises educational materials including illustrated short stories, videos, and scientific texts designed for the different target groups. We suggest that evidence-based health education is included as a specific control measure in any control programme.
25425235	An inner membrane cytochrome required only for reduction of high redox potential extracellular electron acceptors.	UNLABELLED: Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria, such as Geobacter sulfurreducens, transfer electrons beyond their outer membranes to Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides, heavy metals, and electrodes in electrochemical devices. In the environment, metal acceptors exist in multiple chelated and insoluble forms that span a range of redox potentials and offer different amounts of available energy. Despite this, metal-reducing bacteria have not been shown to alter their electron transfer strategies to take advantage of these energy differences. Disruption of imcH, encoding an inner membrane c-type cytochrome, eliminated the ability of G. sulfurreducens to reduce Fe(III) citrate, Fe(III)-EDTA, and insoluble Mn(IV) oxides, electron acceptors with potentials greater than 0.1 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), but the imcH mutant retained the ability to reduce Fe(III) oxides with potentials of ≤-0.1 V versus SHE. The imcH mutant failed to grow on electrodes poised at +0.24 V versus SHE, but switching electrodes to -0.1 V versus SHE triggered exponential growth. At potentials of ≤-0.1 V versus SHE, both the wild type and the imcH mutant doubled 60% slower than at higher potentials. Electrodes poised even 100 mV higher (0.0 V versus SHE) could not trigger imcH mutant growth. These results demonstrate that G. sulfurreducens possesses multiple respiratory pathways, that some of these pathways are in operation only after exposure to low redox potentials, and that electron flow can be coupled to generation of different amounts of energy for growth. The redox potentials that trigger these behaviors mirror those of metal acceptors common in subsurface environments where Geobacter is found. IMPORTANCE: Insoluble metal oxides in the environment represent a common and vast reservoir of energy for respiratory microbes capable of transferring electrons across their insulating membranes to external acceptors, a process termed extracellular electron transfer. Despite the global biogeochemical importance of metal cycling and the ability of such organisms to produce electricity at electrodes, fundamental gaps in the understanding of extracellular electron transfer biochemistry exist. Here, we describe a conserved inner membrane redox protein in Geobacter sulfurreducens which is required only for electron transfer to high-potential compounds, and we show that G. sulfurreducens has the ability to utilize different electron transfer pathways in response to the amount of energy available in a metal or electrode distant from the cell.
23134595	Pandemic influenza A virus codon usage revisited: biases, adaptation and implications for vaccine strain development.	BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae and contains eight segments of a single-stranded RNA genome with negative polarity. The first influenza pandemic of this century was declared in April of 2009, with the emergence of a novel H1N1 IAV strain (H1N1pdm) in Mexico and USA. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. A comprehensive study to investigate the effect of selection pressure imposed by the human host on the codon usage of an emerging, pandemic IAV strain and the trends in viral codon usage involved over the pandemic time period is much needed. RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive codon usage analysis of 310 IAV strains from the pandemic of 2009. Highly biased codon usage for Ala, Arg, Pro, Thr and Ser were found. Codon usage is strongly influenced by underlying biases in base composition. When correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is applied, the distribution of IAV ORFs in the plane defined by the first two major dimensional factors showed that different strains are located at different places, suggesting that IAV codon usage also reflects an evolutionary process. CONCLUSIONS: A general association between codon usage bias, base composition and poor adaptation of the virus to the respective host tRNA pool, suggests that mutational pressure is the main force shaping H1N1 pdm IAV codon usage. A dynamic process is observed in the variation of codon usage of the strains enrolled in these studies. These results suggest a balance of mutational bias and natural selection, which allow the virus to explore and re-adapt its codon usage to different environments. Recoding of IAV taking into account codon bias, base composition and adaptation to host tRNA may provide important clues to develop new and appropriate vaccines.
21985945	Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in head-and-neck cancer: the impact of region of interest selection on the intra- and interpatient variability of pharmacokinetic parameters.	PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI-extracted parameters measure tumor microvascular physiology and are usually calculated from an intratumor region of interest (ROI). Optimal ROI delineation is not established. The valid clinical use of DCE-MRI requires that the variation for any given parameter measured within a tumor be less than that observed between tumors in different patients. This work evaluates the impact of tumor ROI selection on the assessment of intra- and interpatient variability. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Head and neck cancer patients received initial targeted therapy (TT) treatment with erlotinib and/or bevacizumab, followed by radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin with synchronous TT. DCE-MRI data from Baseline and the end of the TT regimen (Lead-In) were analyzed to generate the vascular transfer function (K(trans)), the extracellular volume fraction (v(e)), and the initial area under the concentration time curve (iAUC(1 min)). Four ROI sampling strategies were used: whole tumor or lymph node (Whole), the slice containing the most enhancing voxels (SliceMax), three slices centered in SliceMax (Partial), and the 5% most enhancing contiguous voxels within SliceMax (95Max). The average coefficient of variation (aCV) was calculated to establish intrapatient variability among ROI sets and interpatient variability for each ROI type. The average ratio between each intrapatient CV and the interpatient CV was calculated (aRCV). RESULTS: Baseline primary/nodes aRCVs for different ROIs not including 95Max were, for all three MR parameters, in the range of 0.14-0.24, with Lead-In values between 0.09 and 0.2, meaning a low intrapatient vs. interpatient variation. For 95Max, intrapatient CVs approximated interpatient CVs, meaning similar data dispersion and higher aRCVs (0.6-1.27 for baseline) and 0.54-0.95 for Lead-In. CONCLUSION: Distinction between different patient's primary tumors and/or nodes cannot be made using 95Max ROIs. The other three strategies are viable and equivalent for using DCE-MRI to measure head and neck cancer physiology.
28735894	Geographical variation and trends in outcomes of laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with or without splenic vessel preservation: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Distal pancreatectomy (DP) is performed to treat tumors of the pancreatic body and tail. Traditionally, splenectomy is performed with a DP, however, laparoscopic spleen-preserving DP (SPDP) using Warshaw's (splenic vessels ligation) or Kimura's (splenic vessels preservation) techniques have been reported. The clinical benefits of using either technique remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing Warshaw's and Kimura SPDP. This is the first study to evaluate the geographical variation in outcomes of Warshaw's and Kimura SPDP. METHODS: Databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library were used to identify studies reporting Warshaw's and Kimura SPDP. Clinical outcomes were compared. Pooled odds risk and weighted mean difference with 95% confidence interval were calculated using random effect models. RESULTS: Fourteen non-randomized controlled studies involving 945 patients met our selection criteria. 301 (31.9%) patients underwent Warshaw's SPDP; 644 (68.1%) underwent Kimura SPDP. Compared to Warshaw's SPDP, patients undergoing Kimura SPDP had a lower incidence of post-operative complications including spleen infarction (OR = 9.64, 95% CI = 5.79 to 16.05, P < 0.001) and gastric varices (OR = 11.88, 95% CI = 5.11 to 27.66, P < 0.001). The length of surgery was significantly shorter for Warshaw's SPDP (WMD = -18.12, 95%CI = -26.52 to -9.72, p < 0.001). Decreased blood loss was reported for patients undergoing Warshaw's SPDP (WMD = -59.72, 95%CI = -102.01 to -17.43, p = 0.006). There were no differences between the two groups' rates of conversion to an open procedure (P = 0.35), postoperative pancreatic fistula (P = 0.71), need for reoperation (P = 0.25), and length of hospital stay (P = 0.38). CONCLUSION: Both Warshaw's and Kimura are safe SPDP techniques. These data suggest Kimura SPDP is the preferred technique due to less risk of splenic infarct and gastric varices. Despite evidence of regional variation in volume performed (between Kimura and Warshaw's), there are no statistically significant differences in outcomes between these techniques.

28003808	Microbiome Selection Could Spur Next-Generation Plant Breeding Strategies.	"No plant is an island too…" Plants, though sessile, have developed a unique strategy to counter biotic and abiotic stresses by symbiotically co-evolving with microorganisms and tapping into their genome for this purpose. Soil is the bank of microbial diversity from which a plant selectively sources its microbiome to suit its needs. Besides soil, seeds, which carry the genetic blueprint of plants during trans-generational propagation, are home to diverse microbiota that acts as the principal source of microbial inoculum in crop cultivation. Overall, a plant is ensconced both on the outside and inside with a diverse assemblage of microbiota. Together, the plant genome and the genes of the microbiota that the plant harbors in different plant tissues, i.e., the 'plant microbiome,' form the holobiome which is now considered as unit of selection: 'the holobiont.' The 'plant microbiome' not only helps plants to remain fit but also offers critical genetic variability, hitherto, not employed in the breeding strategy by plant breeders, who traditionally have exploited the genetic variability of the host for developing high yielding or disease tolerant or drought resistant varieties. This fresh knowledge of the microbiome, particularly of the rhizosphere, offering genetic variability to plants, opens up new horizons for breeding that could usher in cultivation of next-generation crops depending less on inorganic inputs, resistant to insect pest and diseases and resilient to climatic perturbations. We surmise, from ever increasing evidences, that plants and their microbial symbionts need to be co-propagated as life-long partners in future strategies for plant breeding. In this perspective, we propose bottom-up approach to co-propagate the co-evolved, the plant along with the target microbiome, through - (i) reciprocal soil transplantation method, or (ii) artificial ecosystem selection method of synthetic microbiome inocula, or (iii) by exploration of microRNA transfer method - for realizing this next-generation plant breeding approach. Our aim, thus, is to bring closer the information accrued through the advanced nucleotide sequencing and bioinformatics in conjunction with conventional culture-dependent isolation method for practical application in plant breeding and overall agriculture.
19337903	Attenuation of silica-induced pulmonary fibroblasts proliferation by taurine and niacin in vitro.	The objective of this study was to investigate potential role of taurine and niacin supplementation, and their combination, in an in vitro model of silica-induced, macrophage-mediated pulmonary fibroblast proliferation. Human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cell) was primed to differentiation into macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PMA-primed THP-1 cells were subjected to silicon dioxide exposure. Other PMA-primed THP-1 cells incubated with taurine and niacin concentration gradients, respectively, and then were treated with silicon dioxide for 6 hours. Collected THP-1 supernatants preconditioned with taurine and niacin gradients were added to human pulmonary WI-38 cells to evaluate proliferative activity. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNA in macrophages and protein level in supernatant were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Taurine- and niacin-preconditioned macrophages were more resistant to silica-induced TGF-beta1 up-regulation than macrophages without precondition. Furthermore, medium conditioned with supernatant from silica-exposed macrophages following taurine and niacin pretreatment could facilitate inhibition of pulmonary fibroblast proliferation. Moreover, the above effects could be accentuated by the combination of taurine and niacin. Down-regulation of TGF-beta 1 expression in macrophages by taurine and niacin could attenuate silica-induced pulmonary fibroblasts proliferation in vitro, which may be of therapeutic potential for early stage silicosis.
24281211	The enigmatic roles of caspases in tumor development.	One function ascribed to apoptosis is the suicidal destruction of potentially harmful cells, such as cancerous cells. Hence, their growth depends on evasion of apoptosis, which is considered as one of the hallmarks of cancer. Apoptosis is ultimately carried out by the sequential activation of initiator and executioner caspases, which constitute a family of intracellular proteases involved in dismantling the cell in an ordered fashion. In cancer, therefore, one would anticipate caspases to be frequently rendered inactive, either by gene silencing or by somatic mutations. From clinical data, however, there is little evidence that caspase genes are impaired in cancer. Executioner caspases have only rarely been found mutated or silenced, and also initiator caspases are only affected in particular types of cancer. There is experimental evidence from transgenic mice that certain initiator caspases, such as caspase-8 and -2, might act as tumor suppressors. Loss of the initiator caspase of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, caspase-9, however, did not promote cellular transformation. These data seem to question a general tumor-suppressive role of caspases. We discuss several possible ways how tumor cells might evade the need for alterations of caspase genes. First, alternative splicing in tumor cells might generate caspase variants that counteract apoptosis. Second, in tumor cells caspases might be kept in check by cellular caspase inhibitors such as c-FLIP or XIAP. Third, pathways upstream of caspase activation might be disrupted in tumor cells. Finally, caspase-independent cell death mechanisms might abrogate the selection pressure for caspase inactivation during tumor development. These scenarios, however, are hardly compatible with the considerable frequency of spontaneous apoptosis occurring in several cancer types. Therefore, alternative concepts might come into play, such as compensatory proliferation. Herein, apoptosis and/or non-apoptotic functions of caspases may even promote tumor development. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that caspases might play non-apoptotic roles in processes that are crucial for tumorigenesis, such as cell proliferation, migration, or invasion. We thus propose a model wherein caspases are preserved in tumor cells due to their functional contributions to development and progression of tumors.
24499679	Synonym extraction and abbreviation expansion with ensembles of semantic spaces.	BACKGROUND: Terminologies that account for variation in language use by linking synonyms and abbreviations to their corresponding concept are important enablers of high-quality information extraction from medical texts. Due to the use of specialized sub-languages in the medical domain, manual construction of semantic resources that accurately reflect language use is both costly and challenging, often resulting in low coverage. Although models of distributional semantics applied to large corpora provide a potential means of supporting development of such resources, their ability to isolate synonymy from other semantic relations is limited. Their application in the clinical domain has also only recently begun to be explored. Combining distributional models and applying them to different types of corpora may lead to enhanced performance on the tasks of automatically extracting synonyms and abbreviation-expansion pairs. RESULTS: A combination of two distributional models - Random Indexing and Random Permutation - employed in conjunction with a single corpus outperforms using either of the models in isolation. Furthermore, combining semantic spaces induced from different types of corpora - a corpus of clinical text and a corpus of medical journal articles - further improves results, outperforming a combination of semantic spaces induced from a single source, as well as a single semantic space induced from the conjoint corpus. A combination strategy that simply sums the cosine similarity scores of candidate terms is generally the most profitable out of the ones explored. Finally, applying simple post-processing filtering rules yields substantial performance gains on the tasks of extracting abbreviation-expansion pairs, but not synonyms. The best results, measured as recall in a list of ten candidate terms, for the three tasks are: 0.39 for abbreviations to long forms, 0.33 for long forms to abbreviations, and 0.47 for synonyms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ensembles of semantic spaces can yield improved performance on the tasks of automatically extracting synonyms and abbreviation-expansion pairs. This notion, which merits further exploration, allows different distributional models - with different model parameters - and different types of corpora to be combined, potentially allowing enhanced performance to be obtained on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.
29250872	The social functions of babbling: acoustic and contextual characteristics that facilitate maternal responsiveness.	What is the social function of babbling? An important function of prelinguistic vocalizing may be to elicit parental behavior in ways that facilitate the infant's own learning about speech and language. Infants use parental feedback to their babbling to learn new vocal forms, but the microstructure of parental responses to babbling has not been studied. To enable precise manipulation of the proximal infant cues that may influence maternal behavior, we used a playback paradigm to assess mothers' responsiveness to prerecorded audiovisual clips of unfamiliar infants' noncry prelinguistic vocalizations and actions. Acoustic characteristics and directedness of vocalizations were manipulated to test their efficacy in structuring social interactions. We also compared maternal responsiveness in the playback paradigm and in free play with their own infants. Maternal patterns of reactions to babbling were stable across both tasks. In the playback task, we found specific vocal cues, such as the degree of resonance and the transition timing of consonant-vowel syllables, predicted contingent maternal responding. Vocalizations directed at objects also facilitated increased responsiveness. The responses mothers exhibited, such as sensitive speech and vocal imitation, are known to facilitate vocal learning and development. Infants, by influencing the behavior of their caregivers with their babbling, create social interactions that facilitate their own communicative development.
26188536	Airflow obstruction was associated with elevation of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity but not ankle-brachial index in aged patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	OBJECTIVE: Both brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) are important predictors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at high risk of CVD. But the association between airflow obstruction and baPWV or ABI was still unclear. The study was aimed to investigate the influencing factors on arterial stiffness in aged COPD patients. METHODS: 67 aged patients with COPD and 67 age- and sex-matched controls without COPD were enrolled in this study. COPD patients were grouped into four groups according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Guidelines (GOLD). Both baPWV and ABI were evaluated. Spirometry indices, blood pressure, smoking history and related laboratory parameters were also collected. RESULTS: Comparing with controls, all COPD patients had significantly higher baPWV (1933 ± 355 cm/s versus 1515 ± 256 cm/s, P < 0.001) but not ABI (P = 0.196). And baPWV values were significantly highest at GOLD stage 4. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was the most significant factor influencing baPWV, after adjusting for age, systolic blood pressure and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors (β = -0.463, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Arterial stiffness was serious in aged patients with COPD. Spirometry index FEV1 was a possible important predictor for the severity of arterial stiffness of COPD patients.
29176979	US6 Gene Deletion in Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Enhances Dendritic Cell Function and T Cell Activation.	Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) produce lifelong infections that are associated with frequent asymptomatic or clinically apparent reactivation. Importantly, HSV express multiple virulence factors that negatively modulate innate and adaptive immune components. Notably, HSV interfere with dendritic cell (DC) viability and function, likely hindering the capacity of the host to mount effective immunity against these viruses. Recently, an HSV-2 virus that was deleted in glycoprotein D was engineered (designated ΔgD-2). The virus is propagated on a complementing cell line that expresses HSV-1 gD, which permits a single round of viral replication. ΔgD-2 is safe, immunogenic, and provided complete protection against vaginal or skin challenges with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in murine models. Here, we sought to assess the interaction of ΔgD-2 with DCs and found that, in contrast to wild-type (WT) virus which induces DC apoptosis, ΔgD-2 promoted their migration and capacity to activate naïve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, DCs exposed to the WT and ΔgD-2 virus experienced different unfolded protein responses. Mice primed with DCs infected with ΔgD-2 in vitro displayed significantly reduced infection and pathology after genital challenge with virulent HSV-2 compared to non-primed mice, suggesting that DCs play a role in the immune response to the vaccine strain.
27820544	The experiences of and meaning for women living and coping with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of qualitative evidence.	BACKGROUND: Effective management of diabetes not only relies on lifestyle modification and adherence to a treatment regime, but also the ability to cope with the impact of the disease on daily activities. Stress associated with the multi-caregiver role of women may affect the ability to manage the disease effectively. OBJECTIVES: To explore the experience of women living and coping with type 2 diabetes. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adult women aged 18 years and above diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.The meaning of living and coping with type 2 diabetes.Qualitative studies, including designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy used sought only to identify published English research papers from the year 1990 to 2010. A three-step search strategy was undertaken. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: The retrieved papers were assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. DATA COLLECTION: Data was extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review data extraction tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: The data were synthesised using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach of meta-synthesis by meta-aggregation. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. Forty-one findings were obtained and then grouped into 11 categories which were then aggregated into four synthesised findings: "Living with type 2 diabetes is emotionally and mentally challenging", "Support (of self, by others, spiritual) provides the ability to cope with diabetes", "Women see their personal responsibility in the management of diabetes and try to maintain their autonomy. Despite this, women place the needs of the family over their own needs thereby resulting in ineffective management" and "Effective management of diabetes is hindered by role duties of women as well as their attitudes and the attitudes of the healthcare providers". CONCLUSIONS: Women are challenged by their multi-caregiving roles and the complexities of managing their diabetes simultaneously. Holistic, individual psycho-education programs for female patients with diabetes and carer programs educating families and friends will facilitate more effective and successful management. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As supported by the evidence obtained in this review, diabetic education programs should include strategies that facilitate emotional coping. Family members should be encouraged to attend diabetes management programs or workshops designed for caregivers or family members to enable them to support female family members with diabetes effectively. Education programs for doctors should focus on the therapeutic helping relationship and the role this relationship plays in facilitating improved health outcomes for patients. IMPLICATION FOR RESEARCH: Implementation of action research with interventions that address the key issues identified in this systematic review would be useful. Additionally, further longitudinal studies that link the incidence and severity of complications and quality of life issues associated with diabetes management to such intervention programs will clarify the benefits, modifying factors and barriers. Despite a plethora of literature examining the coping styles and experiences of Caucasian people with diabetes there is a paucity of literature investigating similar issues among Asian populations. Thus further research studies that examine the experience of living and coping with type 2 diabetes in Asian populations are needed to enhance understanding for these patients.
29263053	A Novel Sex Chromosome Mosaicism 45,X/45,Y/46,XY/46,YY/47,XYY Causing Ambiguous Genitalia.	Sex chromosomal mosaicism has been considered as a major cause of human sexual differentiation disorders, like partial virilization and ambiguous genitalia. 45,X/46,XX, 45,X/46,XY and 46,XY/47,XXY are three most common sex chromosome mosaics associated with human ambiguous genitalia. Here, we report the case of a 3-year-old boy with ambiguous genitalia, bilateral cryptorchidism, and with an inguinal hernia. G banded cytological karyotyping and FISH analyses revealed that the patient has extremely rare and novel sex chromosome mosaic 45,X/45,Y/46,XY/46,YY/47,XYY karyotype. These cells exist in different percentages, important for phenotypic appearance of the patient. This is a first report of an unusual mosaic karyotype causing ambiguous genitalia.
29730080	A decade of marketing approval of gene and cell-based therapies in the United States, European Union and Japan: An evaluation of regulatory decision-making.	There is a widely held expectation of clinical advance with the development of gene and cell-based therapies (GCTs). Yet, establishing benefits and risks is highly uncertain. We examine differences in decision-making for GCT approval between jurisdictions by comparing regulatory assessment procedures in the United States (US), European Union (EU) and Japan. A cohort of 18 assessment procedures was analyzed by comparing product characteristics, evidentiary and non-evidentiary factors considered for approval and post-marketing risk management. Product characteristics are very heterogeneous and only three products are marketed in multiple jurisdictions. Almost half of all approved GCTs received an orphan designation. Overall, confirmatory evidence or indications of clinical benefit were evident in US and EU applications, whereas in Japan approval was solely granted based on non-confirmatory evidence. Due to scientific uncertainties and safety risks, substantial post-marketing risk management activities were requested in the EU and Japan. EU and Japanese authorities often took unmet medical needs into consideration in decision-making for approval. These observations underline the effects of implemented legislation in these two jurisdictions that facilitate an adaptive approach to licensing. In the US, the recent assessments of two chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) products are suggestive of a trend toward a more permissive approach for GCT approval under recent reforms, in contrast to a more binary decision-making approach for previous approvals. It indicates that all three regulatory agencies are currently willing to take risks by approving GCTs with scientific uncertainties and safety risks, urging them to pay accurate attention to post-marketing risk management.
25986137	The Effectiveness of a Physician-Only and Physician-Patient Intervention on Colorectal Cancer Screening Discussions Between Providers and African American and Latino Patients.	BACKGROUND: Physician recommendation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is a critical facilitator of screening completion. Providing patients a choice of screening options may increase CRC screening completion, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of physician-only and physician-patient interventions on increasing rates of CRC screening discussions as compared to usual care. DESIGN: This study was quasi-experimental. Clinics were allocated to intervention or usual care; patients in intervention clinics were randomized to receipt of patient intervention. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 50 to 75 years, due for CRC screening, receiving care at either a federally qualified health care center or an academic health center participated in the study. INTERVENTION: Intervention physicians received continuous quality improvement and communication skills training. Intervention patients watched an educational video immediately before their appointment. MAIN MEASURES: Rates of patient-reported 1) CRC screening discussions, and 2) discussions of more than one screening test. KEY RESULTS: The physician-patient intervention (n = 167) resulted in higher rates of CRC screening discussions compared to both physician-only intervention (n = 183; 61.1 % vs.50.3 %, p = 0.008) and usual care (n = 153; 61.1 % vs. 34.0 % p = 0.03). More discussions of specific CRC screening tests and discussions of more than one test occurred in the intervention arms than in usual care (44.6 % vs. 22.9 %,p = 0.03) and (5.1 % vs. 2.0 %, p = 0.036), respectively, but discussion of more than one test was uncommon. Across all arms, 143 patients (28.4 %) reported discussion of colonoscopy only; 21 (4.2 %) reported discussion of both colonoscopy and stool tests. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to usual care and a physician-only intervention, a physician-patient intervention increased rates of CRC screening discussions, yet discussions overwhelmingly focused solely on colonoscopy. In underserved patient populations where access to colonoscopy may be limited, interventions encouraging discussions of both stool tests and colonoscopy may be needed.
25104932	Slow cortical potential and theta/beta neurofeedback training in adults: effects on attentional processes and motor system excitability.	Neurofeedback (NF) is being successfully applied, among others, in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and as a peak performance training in healthy subjects. However, the neuronal mechanisms mediating a successful NF training have not yet been sufficiently uncovered for both theta/beta (T/B), and slow cortical potential (SCP) training, two protocols established in NF in ADHD. In the present, randomized, controlled investigation in adults without a clinical diagnosis (n = 59), the specificity of the effects of these two NF protocols on attentional processes and motor system excitability were to be examined, focusing on the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Neurofeedback training consisted of 10 double sessions, and self-regulation skills were analyzed. Pre- and post-training assessments encompassed performance and event-related potential measures during an attention task, and motor system excitability assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Some NF protocol-specific effects have been obtained. However, due to the limited sample size medium effects did not reach the level of significance. Self-regulation abilities during negativity trials of the SCP training were associated with increased contingent negative variation amplitudes, indicating improved resource allocation during cognitive preparation. Theta/beta training was associated with increased response speed and decreased target-P3 amplitudes after successful theta/beta regulation suggested reduced attentional resources necessary for stimulus evaluation. Motor system excitability effects after theta/beta training paralleled the effects of methylphenidate. Overall, our results are limited by the non-sufficiently acquired self-regulation skills, but some specific effects between good and poor learners could be described. Future studies with larger sample sizes and sufficient acquisition of self-regulation skills are needed to further evaluate the protocol-specific effects on attention and motor system excitability reported.
20359807	Socio-economic status and oral health-related behaviours in Korean adolescents.	The principle objective of this study was to assess the association between socio-economic status (SES) and oral health-related behaviours in Korean adolescents aged 13-18, using the Family Affluence Scale (FAS). The secondary objective was to assess the influences of other factors (pocket money, school type, family structure and psychological factors) on this association. Cross-sectional data were from the national 2007 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. Oral health-related behaviours included health-enhancing behaviours (frequency of toothbrushing and dental visits) and health-compromising behaviours (smoking and frequency of intake of soft drinks and confections). Logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. To assess the influence of other factors, additional models adjusting for sex, school grade and each of the other factors were compared to the initial model, which adjusted for sex and school grade only. We found that family affluence had a linear association with health-enhancing behaviours and a roughly U-shaped association with health-compromising behaviours. After adjusting for a number of variables, the linear association with health-enhancing behaviours persisted. The U-shaped association with health-compromising behaviours remained but was partly attenuated and flattened. In addition, we found a marked influence of school type and family structure and pocket money on the association between FAS and oral health-compromising behaviours. The findings indicate that the health-enhancing behaviours of adolescents were strongly associated with family affluence, but the health-compromising behaviours were more strongly linked to factors other than family affluence. However, it is difficult to determine which factors contribute most in relation to family affluence because of other confounding factors, such as the education system, peer group, youth culture, part-time work and advertising. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess factors that interact with family SES to better understand the association between the SES and the oral health-compromising behaviours of adolescents.
29485024	Overexpression of MicroRNA-29b Decreases Expression of DNA Methyltransferases and Improves Quality of the Blastocysts Derived from Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer in Cattle.	MicroRNA (miR)-29b plays a crucial role during somatic cell reprogramming. The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of miR-29b on the developmental competence of bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos, as well as the underlying mechanisms of action. The expression level of miR-29b was lower in bovine SCNT embryos at the pronuclear, 8-cell, and blastocyst stages compared with in vitro fertilized embryos. In addition, miR-29b regulates the expression of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt3a/3b and Dnmt1) in bovine SCNT embryos. We further investigated SCNT embryo developmental competence and found that miR-29b overexpression during bovine SCNT embryonic development does not improve developmental potency and downregulation inhibits developmental potency. Nevertheless, the quality of bovine SCNT embryos at the blastocyst stage improved significantly. The expression of pluripotency factors and cellular proliferation were significantly higher in blastocysts from the miR-29b overexpression group than the control and downregulation groups. In addition, outgrowth potential in blastocysts after miR-29b overexpression was also significantly greater in the miR-29b overexpression group than in the control and downregulation groups. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-29b plays an important role in bovine SCNT embryo development.
27341204	Task-Related Edge Density (TED)-A New Method for Revealing Dynamic Network Formation in fMRI Data of the Human Brain.	The formation of transient networks in response to external stimuli or as a reflection of internal cognitive processes is a hallmark of human brain function. However, its identification in fMRI data of the human brain is notoriously difficult. Here we propose a new method of fMRI data analysis that tackles this problem by considering large-scale, task-related synchronisation networks. Networks consist of nodes and edges connecting them, where nodes correspond to voxels in fMRI data, and the weight of an edge is determined via task-related changes in dynamic synchronisation between their respective times series. Based on these definitions, we developed a new data analysis algorithm that identifies edges that show differing levels of synchrony between two distinct task conditions and that occur in dense packs with similar characteristics. Hence, we call this approach "Task-related Edge Density" (TED). TED proved to be a very strong marker for dynamic network formation that easily lends itself to statistical analysis using large scale statistical inference. A major advantage of TED compared to other methods is that it does not depend on any specific hemodynamic response model, and it also does not require a presegmentation of the data for dimensionality reduction as it can handle large networks consisting of tens of thousands of voxels. We applied TED to fMRI data of a fingertapping and an emotion processing task provided by the Human Connectome Project. TED revealed network-based involvement of a large number of brain areas that evaded detection using traditional GLM-based analysis. We show that our proposed method provides an entirely new window into the immense complexity of human brain function.
28035024	Preprocessing, normalization and integration of the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array with minfi.	Summary: The minfi package is widely used for analyzing Illumina DNA methylation array data. Here we describe modifications to the minfi package required to support the HumanMethylationEPIC ('EPIC') array from Illumina. We discuss methods for the joint analysis and normalization of data from the HumanMethylation450 ('450k') and EPIC platforms. We introduce the single-sample Noob ( ssNoob ) method, a normalization procedure suitable for incremental preprocessing of individual methylation arrays and conclude that this method should be used when integrating data from multiple generations of Infinium methylation arrays. We show how to use reference 450k datasets to estimate cell type composition of samples on EPIC arrays. The cumulative effect of these updates is to ensure that minfi provides the tools to best integrate existing and forthcoming Illumina methylation array data. Availability and Implementation: The minfi package version 1.19.12 or higher is available for all platforms from the Bioconductor project. Contact: khansen@jhsph.edu. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
18457595	Age- and calorie-independent life span extension from dietary restriction by bacterial deprivation in Caenorhabditis elegans.	BACKGROUND: Dietary restriction (DR) increases life span and delays age-associated disease in many organisms. The mechanism by which DR enhances longevity is not well understood. RESULTS: Using bacterial food deprivation as a means of DR in C. elegans, we show that transient DR confers long-term benefits including stress resistance and increased longevity. Consistent with studies in the fruit fly and in mice, we demonstrate that DR also enhances survival when initiated late in life. DR by bacterial food deprivation significantly increases life span in worms when initiated as late as 24 days of adulthood, an age at which greater than 50% of the cohort have died. These survival benefits are, at least partially, independent of food consumption, as control fed animals are no longer consuming bacterial food at this advanced age. Animals separated from the bacterial lawn by a barrier of solid agar have a life span intermediate between control fed and food restricted animals. Thus, we find that life span extension from bacterial deprivation can be partially suppressed by a diffusible component of the bacterial food source, suggesting a calorie-independent mechanism for life span extension by dietary restriction. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we propose that dietary restriction by bacterial deprivation increases longevity in C. elegans by a combination of reduced food consumption and decreased food sensing.
29382880	Antibody-mediated enhancement aggravates chikungunya virus infection and disease severity.	The arthropod-transmitted chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes a flu-like disease that is characterized by incapacitating arthralgia. The re-emergence of CHIKV and the continual risk of new epidemics have reignited research in CHIKV pathogenesis. Virus-specific antibodies have been shown to control virus clearance, but antibodies present at sub-neutralizing concentrations can also augment virus infection that exacerbates disease severity. To explore this occurrence, CHIKV infection was investigated in the presence of CHIKV-specific antibodies in both primary human cells and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. Enhanced attachment of CHIKV to the primary human monocytes and B cells was observed while increased viral replication was detected in RAW264.7 cells. Blocking of specific Fc receptors (FcγRs) led to the abrogation of these observations. Furthermore, experimental infection in adult mice showed that animals had higher viral RNA loads and endured more severe joint inflammation in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies. In addition, CHIKV infection in 11 days old mice under enhancing condition resulted in higher muscles viral RNA load detected and death. These observations provide the first evidence of antibody-mediated enhancement in CHIKV infection and pathogenesis and could also be relevant for other important arboviruses such as Zika virus.
18339139	Low incidence of secondary neoplasia after autotransplantation for lymphoproliferative disease: the role of pre-transplant therapy.	To asses the real contribution of pre-transplantation treatment in the incidence of secondary neoplasia after autologous transplant for lymphoproliferative disorders, we used stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. One hundred and forty-two patients out of 323 that underwent autologous transplantation for lymphoproliferative disorders were studied. The risk factors that were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis included: gender, sex, age, diagnosis, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy prior to conditioning regimen, disease status at peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) and type of harvest. Three patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (sMDS/AML) and three patients developed solid neoplasia. By univariate analysis diagnosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia and use of fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies were the only variables significantly associated with the development of sMDS/AML. By multivariate analysis, the variables associated with sMDS/AML were the use of fludarabine and disease status at PBSCT. By univariate analysis, we found that radiotherapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies were significantly associated with the development of secondary solid neoplasia. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the only two variables significantly associated with new cancers were radiotherapy and prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies. We report the lowest incidence of sMDS/AML after autologous stem-cell transplantation for lymphoproliferative malignancies. Major reasons could be ascribed to the stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria used to establish the real incidence of sMDS/AML because of chemo-radiotherapy used before transplant procedure. The low incidence of secondary solid tumors could be caused by the absence of total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen or the short follow-up.
21554405	Annotation of sheep keratin intermediate filament genes and their patterns of expression.	Keratin IF (KRT) and keratin-associated protein genes encode the majority of wool and hair proteins. We have identified cDNA sequences representing nine novel sheep KRT genes, increasing the known active genes from eight to 17, a number comparable to that in the human. However, the absence of KRT37 in the type I family and the discovery of type II KRT87 in sheep exemplify species-specific compositional differences in hair KRT genes. Phylogenetic analysis of hair KRT genes within type I and type II families in the sheep, cattle and human genomes revealed a high degree of consistency in their sequence conservation and grouping. However, there were differences in the fibre compartmentalisation and keratinisation zones for the expression of six ovine KRT genes compared with their human orthologs. Transcripts of three genes (KRT40, KRT82 and KRT84) were only present in the fibre cuticle. KRT32, KRT35 and KRT85 were expressed in both the cuticle and the fibre cortex. The remaining 11 genes (KRT31, KRT33A, KRT33B, KRT34, KRT36, KRT38-39, KRT81, KRT83 and KRT86-87) were expressed only in the cortex. Species-specific differences in the expressed keratin gene sets, their relative expression levels and compartmentalisation are discussed in the context of their underlying roles in wool and hair developmental programmes and the distinctive characteristics of the fibres produced.
25477517	Impaired association of retinal degeneration-3 with guanylate cyclase-1 and guanylate cyclase-activating protein-1 leads to leber congenital amaurosis-1.	One-fifth of all cases of Leber congenital amaurosis are type 1 (LCA1). LCA1 is a severe form of retinal dystrophy caused by loss-of-function mutations in guanylate cyclase 1 (GC1), a key member of the phototransduction cascade involved in modulating the photocurrents. Although GC1 has been studied for some time, the mechanisms responsible for its regulation and membrane targeting are not fully understood. We reported earlier that retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein interacts with GC1 and promotes its targeting to the photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Here, we extend our studies to show a direct association between RD3 and guanylate cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP1). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this functional interaction is important for GC1 targeting to POS. We also show that most LCA1-causing mutations in GC1 result in lost GC1 interaction with RD3 or GC1 being targeted to the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that GC1, GCAP1, and RD3 form a complex in the endoplasmic reticulum that targets GC1 to POS. Interruption of this assembly is likely the underlying mechanism for a subset of LCA1. This study offers insights for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat this severe form of blindness.
26627931	Structure and function of ER membrane contact sites with other organelles.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest organelle in the cell, and its functions have been studied for decades. The past several years have provided novel insights into the existence of distinct domains between the ER and other organelles, known as membrane contact sites (MCSs). At these contact sites, organelle membranes are closely apposed and tethered, but do not fuse. Here, various protein complexes can work in concert to perform specialized functions such as binding, sensing and transferring molecules, as well as engaging in organelle biogenesis and dynamics. This Review describes the structure and functions of MCSs, primarily focusing on contacts of the ER with mitochondria and endosomes.
29498648	Citizen Science and Community Engagement in Tick Surveillance-A Canadian Case Study.	Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and on-going surveillance is required to monitor the spread of the tick vectors as their populations expand under the influence of climate change. Active surveillance involves teams of researchers collecting ticks from field locations with the potential to be sites of establishing tick populations. This process is labor- and time-intensive, limiting the number of sites monitored and the frequency of monitoring. Citizen science initiatives are ideally suited to address this logistical problem and generate high-density and complex data from sites of community importance. In 2014, the same region was monitored by academic researchers, public health workers, and citizen scientists, allowing a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each type of surveillance effort. Four community members persisted with tick collections over several years, collectively recovering several hundred ticks. Although deviations from standard surveillance protocols and the choice of tick surveillance sites makes the incorporation of community-generated data into conventional surveillance analyses more complex, this citizen science data remains useful in providing high-density longitudinal tick surveillance of a small area in which detailed ecological observations can be made. Most importantly, partnership between community members and researchers has proven a powerful tool in educating communities about of the risk of tick-vectored diseases and in encouraging tick bite prevention.
29545726	Germline mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Among which, about 1%-3% of gastric cancer patients were characterized by inherited gastric cancer predisposition syndromes, knowing as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Studies reported that CDH1 germline mutations are the main cause of HDGC. With the help of rapid development of genetic testing technologies and data analysis tools, more and more researchers focus on seeking candidate susceptibility genes for hereditary cancer syndromes. In addition, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that the patients of HDGC carrying CDH1 mutations should undergo prophylactic gastrectomy or routine endoscopic surveillances. Therefore, genetic counseling plays a key role in helping individuals with pathogenic mutations make appropriate risk management plans. Moreover, experienced and professional genetic counselors as well as a systematic multidisciplinary team (MDT) are also required to facilitate the development of genetic counseling and benefit pathogenic mutation carriers who are in need of regular and standardized risk management solutions. In this review, we provided an overview about the germline mutations of several genes identified in HDGC, suggesting that these genes may potentially act as susceptibility genes for this malignant cancer syndrome. Furthermore, we introduced information for prevention, diagnosis and risk management of HDGC. Investigations on key factors that may have effect on risk management decision-making and genetic data collection of more cancer syndrome family pedigrees are required for the development of HDGC therapeutic strategies.
28343221	Abandoning Prophylactic Abdominal Drainage after Hepatic Surgery: 10 Years of No-Drain Policy in an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Environment.	BACKGROUND: Routine prophylactic abdominal drainage after hepatic surgery is still being debated, as it may be unnecessary, possibly harmful, and uncomfortable for patients. This study evaluated the safety of a no-drain policy after liver resection within an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. METHODS: All hepatectomies performed without prophylactic drainage during 2005-2014 were included. Primary end points were resection-surface-related (RSR) morbidity, defined as the presence of postoperative biloma, hemorrhage or abscess, and reinterventions. Secondary end points were length of stay, total postoperative morbidity, the composite end point of liver surgery-specific complications, readmissions, and 90-day mortality. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for RSR morbidity. A systematic search was performed to compare the results of this study to literature. RESULTS: A total of 538 resections were included in the study. The RSR complication and reintervention rate was 15 and 12%, respectively. Major liver resection (≥3 segments) was an independent risk factor for the development of RSR morbidity (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.61-5.62; p = 0.001) and need for RSR reintervention (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.59-5.73; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: RSR morbidity, mortality, and reintervention rates after liver surgery without prophylactic drainage in patients, treated within an ERAS programme, were comparable to previously published data. A no-drain policy after partial hepatectomy seems safe and feasible.
18625775	Cell density and cell aging as factors modulating antifungal resistance of Candida albicans biofilms.	Biofilm formation is a major virulence attribute of Candida pathogenicity which contributes to higher antifungal resistance. We investigated the roles of cell density and cellular aging on the relative antifungal susceptibility of planktonic, biofilm, and biofilm-derived planktonic modes of Candida. A reference and a wild-type strain of Candida albicans were used to evaluate the MICs of caspofungin (CAS), amphotericin B (AMB), nystatin (NYT), ketoconazole (KTC), and flucytosine (5FC). Standard, NCCLS, and European Committee on Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing methods were used for planktonic MIC determination. Candida biofilms were then developed on polystyrene wells, and MICs were determined with a standard 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide assay. Subsequently, antifungal susceptibility testing was performed for greater inoculum concentrations and 24- and 48-h-old cultures of planktonic Candida. Furthermore, Candida biofilm-derived planktonic cells (BDPC) were also subjected to antifungal susceptibility testing. The MICs for both C. albicans strains in the planktonic mode were low, although on increasing the inoculum concentration (up to 1 x 10(8) cells/ml), a variable MIC was noted. On the contrary, for Candida biofilms, the MICs of antifungals were 15- to >1,000-fold higher. Interestingly, the MICs for BDPC were lower and were similar to those for planktonic-mode cells, particularly those of CAS and AMB. Our data indicate that higher antifungal resistance of Candida biofilms is an intrinsic feature possibly related to the biofilm architecture rather than cellular density or cellular aging.
24905024	Effect of exercise-induced enhancement of the leg-extensor muscle-tendon unit capacities on ambulatory mechanics and knee osteoarthritis markers in the elderly.	OBJECTIVE: Leg-extensor muscle weakness could be a key component in knee joint degeneration in the elderly because it may result in altered muscular control during locomotion influencing the mechanical environment within the joint. This work aimed to examine whether an exercise-induced enhancement of the triceps surae (TS) and quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle-tendon unit (MTU) capacities would affect mechanical and biological markers for knee osteoarthritis in the elderly. METHODS: Twelve older women completed a 14-week TS and QF MTU exercise intervention, which had already been established as increasing muscle strength and tendon stiffness. Locomotion mechanics and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) levels were examined during incline walking. MTU mechanical properties were assessed using simultaneously ultrasonography and dynamometry. RESULTS: Post exercise intervention, the elderly had higher TS and QF contractile strength and tendon-aponeurosis stiffness. Regarding the incline gait task, the subjects demonstrated a lower external knee adduction moment and lower knee adduction angular impulse during the stance phase post-intervention. Furthermore, post-intervention compared to pre-intervention, the elderly showed lower external hip adduction moment, but revealed higher plantarflexion pushoff moment. The changes in the external knee adduction moment were significantly correlated with the improvement in ankle pushoff function. Serum COMP concentration increased in response to the 0.5-h incline walking exercise with no differences in the magnitude of increment between pre- and post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This work emphasizes the important role played by the ankle pushoff function in knee joint mechanical loading during locomotion, and may justify the inclusion of the TS MTU in prevention programs aiming to positively influence specific mechanical markers for knee osteoarthritis in the elderly. However, the study was unable to show that COMP is amenable to change in the elderly following a 14-week exercise intervention and, therefore, the physiological benefit of improved muscle function for knee cartilage requires further investigation.
18702835	Molecular medicine of microRNAs: structure, function and implications for diabetes.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of endogenous small noncoding RNA molecules, of 19-28 nucleotides in length. In humans, up to 3% of all genes are estimated to encode these evolutionarily conserved sequences. miRNAs are thought to control expression of thousands of target mRNAs. Mammalian miRNAs generally negatively regulate gene expression by repressing translation, possibly through effects on mRNA stability and compartmentalisation, and/or the translation process itself. An extensive range of in silico and experimental techniques have been applied to our understanding of the occurrence and functional relevance of such sequences, and antisense technologies have been successfully used to control miRNA expression in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, miRNAs have been identified in both normal and pathological conditions, including differentiation and development, metabolism, proliferation, cell death, viral infection and cancer. Of specific relevance and excitement to the area of diabetes research, miRNA regulation has been implicated in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, diabetic heart conditions and nephropathy. Further analyses of miRNAs in vitro and in vivo will, undoubtedly, enable us determine their potential to be exploited as therapeutic targets in diabetes.
28438921	Null expectations for disease dynamics in shrinking habitat: dilution or amplification?	As biodiversity declines with anthropogenic land-use change, it is increasingly important to understand how changing biodiversity affects infectious disease risk. The dilution effect hypothesis, which points to decreases in biodiversity as critical to an increase in infection risk, has received considerable attention due to the allure of a win-win scenario for conservation and human well-being. Yet some empirical data suggest that the dilution effect is not a generalizable phenomenon. We explore the response of pathogen transmission dynamics to changes in biodiversity that are driven by habitat loss using an allometrically scaled multi-host model. With this model, we show that declining habitat, and thus declining biodiversity, can lead to either increasing or decreasing infectious-disease risk, measured as endemic prevalence. Whether larger habitats, and thus greater biodiversity, lead to a decrease (dilution effect) or increase (amplification effect) in infection prevalence depends upon the pathogen transmission mode and how host competence scales with body size. Dilution effects were detected for most frequency-transmitted pathogens and amplification effects were detected for density-dependent pathogens. Amplification effects were also observed over a particular range of habitat loss in frequency-dependent pathogens when we assumed that host competence was greatest in large-bodied species. By contrast, only amplification effects were observed for density-dependent pathogens; host competency only affected the magnitude of the effect. These models can be used to guide future empirical studies of biodiversity-disease relationships across gradients of habitat loss. The type of transmission, the relationship between host competence and community assembly, the identity of hosts contributing to transmission, and how transmission scales with area are essential factors to consider when elucidating the mechanisms driving disease risk in shrinking habitat.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.
27733097	Prediction of Differentiation Tendency Toward Hepatocytes from Gene Expression in Undifferentiated Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.	Functional hepatocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have potential as tools for predicting drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the early phases of drug development. However, the propensity of hPSC lines to differentiate into specific lineages is reported to differ. The ability to predict low propensity of hPSCs to differentiate into hepatocytes would facilitate the selection of useful hPSC clones and substantially accelerate development of hPSC-derived hepatocytes for pharmaceutical research. In this study, we compared the expression of genes associated with hepatic differentiation in five hPSC lines including human ES cell line, H9, which is known to differentiate into hepatocytes, and an hPSC line reported with a poor propensity for hepatic differentiation. Genes distinguishing between undifferentiated hPSCs, hPSC-derived hepatoblast-like differentiated cells, and primary human hepatocytes were drawn by two-way cluster analysis. The order of expression levels of genes in undifferentiated hPSCs was compared with that in hPSC-derived hepatoblast-like cells. Three genes were selected as predictors of low propensity for hepatic differentiation. Expression of these genes was investigated in 23 hPSC clones. Review of representative cells by induction of hepatic differentiation suggested that low prediction scores were linked with low hepatic differentiation. Thus, our model using gene expression ranking and bioinformatic analysis could reasonably predict poor differentiation propensity of hPSC lines.
22895937	Blood pressure lowering efficacy of loop diuretics for primary hypertension.	BACKGROUND: Antihypertensive drugs from the thiazide diuretic drug class have been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Loop diuretics are indicated and used as antihypertensive drugs but a systematic review of their blood pressure lowering efficacy or effectiveness in terms of reducing cardiovascular mortality or morbidity from randomized controlled trial evidence has not been conducted. OBJECTIVES: To determine the dose related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure as well as adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids profile) due to loop diuretics versus placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: Medline (1946-February 2012), EMBASE (1974-February 2012), CENTRAL (issue 2, 2012) and bibliographic citations were searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double blind randomized placebo controlled trials of at least 3 weeks duration comparing loop diuretic with a placebo in patients with primary hypertension defined as BP >140/90 mmHg at baseline were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Weighted mean difference and a fixed effects model were used to combine continuous outcome data. The drop outs due to adverse effects was analysed using relative risk ratio. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials evaluated the dose-related blood pressure lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 to 60mg, cicletanine 100 to 150 mg, piretanide 3 to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 to -10.0/+80 mg and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 patients with baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of 8.8 weeks. The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood pressure lowering efficacy of loop diuretics was -7.9 (-10.5, -5.4) mmHg/ -4.4 (-5.6, -2.8) mmHg . Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference.The 2012 updated search resulted in no additional new trials meeting the minimum inclusion criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure lowering effect of loop diuretics is modest (-8/-4 mmHg) and is likely an overestimate due to the high risk of bias in the included studies. There are no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class. The dose ranging effects of loop diuretics could not be evaluated. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with loop diuretics because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.
19438150	Effectiveness and safety of levosimendan in clinical practice.	BACKGROUND: In previous randomized studies levosimendan improved hemodynamics and clinical course, with a still unclear effect on prognosis. There are, however, few data regarding its effects when used in daily practice. AIMS: We evaluated the clinical effectiveness and safety of levosimendan in the treatment of acute systolic heart failure (SHF) in daily practice conditions. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized trial, a continuous infusion of levosimendan (0.05 microg/kg/min-0.2 microg/kg/min) was administered for 24 hours. An optional loading dose of 12 microg/kg over 10 minutes was used. The primary combined endpoint of clinical effectiveness (as defined by a eight-variable clinical score) and safety (defined by the absence of serious adverse events) was assessed at 24 hours after the beginning of treatment; a second similar primary combined endpoint was assessed at 5 days. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients requiring inotropes despite optimal oral background heart failure therapy were recruited. The primary endpoint was reached in 80.6% at 24 hours and in 79.7% at 5 days. During the six months before levosimendan the number of patient days of hospitalization for heart failure was 14.9 +/- 14.6 versus 3.1 +/- 7.6 during the six months following levosimendan (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In daily practice, levosimendan was clinically effective and safe in 80.6% and 79.7% of patients with acute SHF at 24 hours and 5 days respectively after the beginning of treatment. A marked reduction in the number of days of hospitalization for heart failure was also seen during the subsequent six months.
18361715	Use of an electrostatic dust cloth for self-administered home allergen collection.	Most epidemiologic studies employ a vacuum cleaner used by a trained technician to collect household allergens. This approach is labor intensive, equipment dependent, and impractical if study subjects reside over a wide geographic area. We examined the feasibility of a self-administered dust collection method, using an electrostatic cloth sent by conventional mail, to obtain allergen measurements. Thirty-two nonasthmatic twins from the California Twin Program wiped areas in the family room, kitchen, and bedroom, according to standardized instructions, and returned the cloths by mail. Allergen concentrations for Der-p-1, Der-f-1, Fel-d-1, and Bla-g-2 were determined using ELISA, and intrahouse and room-to-room concentrations were compared. Der-p-1 and Fel-d-1 were found in most homes, with highest concentrations in bedrooms and kitchens, respectively. Der-f-1 and Bla-g-2 were rarely found. Intrahouse Der-p-1 and Fel-d-1 concentrations were highly correlated and statistically significant (for Der-p-1, bedroom vs. kitchen, p=.0003, bedroom vs. family room, p=.0001, and family room vs. kitchen, p=.002; for Fel-d-1, bedroom vs. kitchen, p=.0004, bedroom vs. family room, p<.0001, and family room vs. kitchen, p=.0001). Reported cat ownership was strongly correlated with household Fel-d-1 concentrations (p<.005). In another comparison from different homes of children enrolled in the La Casa atopy prevention study, allergen concentrations measured from dust collected by a single operator from the left and right half of the same room in 21 homes were compared. Levels of Bla-g-2, Der-p-1, and Fel-d-1 concentrations collected from right and left halves of the same room were highly correlated, with r2 ranging from .7 to .9, and were highly statistically significant (all p values<.01). We conclude that nonintrusive and self-administered dust collection, using commercially available electrostatic dust cloths, sent by conventional mail services, is a promising alternative to technician-collected vacuumed dust for measuring indoor allergens in population-based studies, although further validation of the method is necessary.
29669529	Improving quality of life through the routine use of the patient concerns inventory for head and neck cancer patients: a cluster preference randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: The consequences of treatment for Head and Neck cancer (HNC) patients has profound detrimental impacts such as impaired QOL, emotional distress, delayed recovery and frequent use of healthcare. The aim of this trial is to determine if the routine use of the Patients Concerns Inventory (PCI) package in review clinics during the first year following treatment can improve overall quality of life, reduce the social-emotional impact of cancer and reduce levels of distress. Furthermore, we aim to describe the economic costs and benefits of using the PCI. METHODS: This will be a cluster preference randomised control trial with consultants either 'using' or 'not using' the PCI package at clinic. It will involve two centres Leeds and Liverpool. 416 eligible patients from at least 10 consultant clusters are required to show a clinically meaningful difference in the primary outcome. The primary outcome is the percentage of participants with less than good overall quality of life at the final one-year clinic as measured by the University of Washington QOL questionnaire version 4 (UWQOLv4). Secondary outcomes at one-year are the mean social-emotional subscale (UWQOLv4) score, Distress Thermometer (DT) score ≥ 4, and key health economic measures (QALY-EQ-5D-5 L; CSRI). DISCUSSION: This trial will provide knowledge on the effectiveness of a consultation intervention package based around the PCI used at routine follow-up clinics following treatment of head and neck cancer with curative intent. If this intervention is (cost) effective for patients, the next step will be to promote wider use of this approach as standard care in clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 32,382. Clinical Trials Identifier, NCT03086629 . PROTOCOL: Version 3.0, 1st July 2017.
21630549	Dynamic MR imaging of kidneys perfused with EOB-Gd-DTPA.	Gandolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is a hepatobiliary contrast agent for MRI. It was reported that Gd-EOB-DTPA is useful to detect liver tumors and differentially diagnose benign and malignant pathologies in the liver. Since Gd-EOB-DTPA partially accumulates in the hepatocytes and bile via various transporters after intravenous injection, signal intensity in the liver increases on T1-weighted images. The signal intensity of the liver after Gd-EOB-DTPA injection depends on the Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake by hepatocytes and bile excretion. It is known tha the Gd-EOB-DTPA accumulating in the kidney is excreted to the urine through glomerular filtration. Because Gd-DTPA is concentrated in the renal tubules after being filtered at the Bowman's capsule, and since it is neither secreted nor reabsorbed the concentrating and diluting function of the renal tubules can be studied by imaging techniques. since renal function can be evaluated with Gd-EOB-DTPA can also be used to evaluate renal function. Eith the development of MRI equipment and rapid imaging techniques, temporal resolution had improved greatly. However, no previous study has been carried out on renal function using Gd-EOB-DTPA dynamic MR study that was correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Japan Association of chronic kidney disease initiative.
28468861	Detection of Emerging Vaccine-Related Polioviruses by Deep Sequencing.	Oral poliovirus vaccine can mutate to regain neurovirulence. To date, evaluation of these mutations has been performed primarily on culture-enriched isolates by using conventional Sanger sequencing. We therefore developed a culture-independent, deep-sequencing method targeting the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and P1 genomic region to characterize vaccine-related poliovirus variants. Error analysis of the deep-sequencing method demonstrated reliable detection of poliovirus mutations at levels of <1%, depending on read depth. Sequencing of viral nucleic acids from the stool of vaccinated, asymptomatic children and their close contacts collected during a prospective cohort study in Veracruz, Mexico, revealed no vaccine-derived polioviruses. This was expected given that the longest duration between sequenced sample collection and the end of the most recent national immunization week was 66 days. However, we identified many low-level variants (<5%) distributed across the 5' UTR and P1 genomic region in all three Sabin serotypes, as well as vaccine-related viruses with multiple canonical mutations associated with phenotypic reversion present at high levels (>90%). These results suggest that monitoring emerging vaccine-related poliovirus variants by deep sequencing may aid in the poliovirus endgame and efforts to ensure global polio eradication.
24933624	Passion fruit peel extract attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive fatal lung disease characterized by excessive collagen deposition, with no effective treatments. We investigated the efficacy of natural products with high anti-inflammatory activity, such as passion fruit peel extract (PFPE), in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF). C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin to induce PF. Daily PFPE treatment significantly reduced loss of body mass and mortality rate in mice compared with those treated with bleomycin. While bleomycin-induced PF resulted in elevated total numbers of inflammatory cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on both days 7 and 21, PFPE administration significantly attenuated these phenomena compared with bleomycin group. On day 7, the decreased superoxide dismutase and myeloperoxidase activities observed in the bleomycin group were significantly restored with PFPE treatment. On day 21, enhanced hydroxyproline deposition in the bleomycin group was also suppressed by PFPE administration. PFPE treatment significantly attenuated extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and accumulation of collagen in lung tissue sections of bleomycin-induced mice on days 7 and 21, respectively. Our results indicate that administration of PFPE decreased bleomycin-induced PF because of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.
25660089	Analysis of operating costs for producing biodiesel from palm oil at pilot-scale in Colombia.	The present study aims to evaluate the operating costs of biodiesel production using palm oil in a pilot-scale plant with a capacity of 20,000 L/day (850 L/batch). The production plant uses crude palm oil as a feedstock, and methanol in a molar ratio of 1:10. The process incorporated acid esterification, basic transesterification, and dry washing with absorbent powder. Production costs considered in the analysis were feedstock, supplies, labor, electricity, quality and maintenance; amounting to $3.75/gal ($0.99/L) for 2013. Feedstocks required for biodiesel production were among the highest costs, namely 72.6% of total production cost. Process efficiency to convert fatty acids to biodiesel was over 99% and generated a profit of $1.08/gal (i.e., >22% of the total income). According to sensitivity analyses, it is more economically viable for biodiesel production processes to use crude palm oil as a feedstock and take advantage of the byproducts such as glycerine and fertilizers.
19343682	Disease recognition by infrared and Raman spectroscopy.	Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy are emerging biophotonic tools to recognize various diseases. The current review gives an overview of the experimental techniques, data-classification algorithms and applications to assess soft tissues, hard tissues and body fluids. The methodology section presents the principles to combine vibrational spectroscopy with microscopy, lateral information and fiber-optic probes. A crucial step is the classification of spectral data by a variety of algorithms. We discuss unsupervised algorithms such as cluster analysis or principal component analysis and supervised algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis, soft independent modeling of class analogies, artificial neural networks support vector machines, Bayesian classification, partial least-squares regression and ensemble methods. The selected topics include tumors of epithelial tissue, brain tumors, prion diseases, bone diseases, atherosclerosis, kidney stones and gallstones, skin tumors, diabetes and osteoarthritis.
28054059	A three-way junction structure-based isothermal exponential amplification strategy for sensitive detection of 3'-terminal 2'-O-methylated plant microRNA.	Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) differ from animal miRNAs in that they are 2'-O-methylated at the 3' end nucleotide which limits the ability of plant miRNAs to serve as primers for polymerization reactions. Herein, we have rationally designed a three-way junction structure-based isothermal exponential amplification reaction (3WJ-EXPAR) which is well-suited for sensitive detection of 3'-terminal 2'-O-methylated miRNAs.
21204530	Structure and interactions of plant cell-wall polysaccharides by two- and three-dimensional magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR.	The polysaccharide-rich cell walls (CWs) of plants perform essential functions such as maintaining tensile strength and allowing plant growth. Using two- and three-dimensional magic-angle-spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR and uniformly (13)C-labeled Arabidopsis thaliana, we have assigned the resonances of the major polysaccharides in the intact and insoluble primary CW and determined the intermolecular contacts and dynamics of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins. Cellulose microfibrils showed extensive interactions with pectins, while the main hemicellulose, xyloglucan, exhibited few cellulose cross-peaks, suggesting limited entrapment in the microfibrils rather than extensive surface coating. Site-resolved (13)C T(1) and (1)H T(1ρ) relaxation times indicate that the entrapped xyloglucan has motional properties that are intermediate between the rigid cellulose and the dynamic pectins. Xyloglucan absence in a triple knockout mutant caused the polysaccharides to undergo much faster motions than in the wild-type CW. These results suggest that load bearing in plant CWs is accomplished by a single network of all three types of polysaccharides instead of a cellulose-xyloglucan network, thus revising the existing paradigm of CW structure. The extensive pectin-cellulose interaction suggests a central role for pectins in maintaining the structure and function of plant CWs. This study demonstrates the power of multidimensional MAS NMR for molecular level investigation of the structure and dynamics of complex and energy-rich plant materials.
21645115	Abuse-related post-traumatic stress, coping, and tobacco use in pregnancy.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between trauma history, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), coping, and smoking in a diverse sample of pregnant women, some of whom are active smokers. DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a prospective study on PTSD and pregnancy outcomes. SETTING: Maternity clinics at three health systems in the midwestern United States. PARTICIPANTS: Women age 18 or older (1,547) interviewed at gestational age fewer than 28 weeks. METHODS: Participants were classified at nonsmokers, quitters (stopped smoking during pregnancy), and pregnancy smokers. Demographic, trauma, and pregnancy factors, substance use, and use of tobacco to cope were compared across groups. Logistic regression assessed the influence of these factors on being a smoker versus a nonsmoker and a quitter versus a pregnancy smoker. RESULTS: Smokers differed from nonsmokers on all demographic risk factors (being African American, being pregnant as a teen, having lower income and less education, and living in high-crime areas), had higher rates of current and lifetime PTSD, and were more likely to report abuse as their worst trauma. Pregnancy smokers had lower levels of education, were more likely to classify their worst trauma as "extremely troubling," and were more likely to exhibit PTSD hyperarousal symptoms. In regression models, smoking "to cope with emotions and problems" doubled the odds of continuing to smoke while pregnant even after accounting for several relevant risk factors. CONCLUSION: Smoking behavior in pregnancy may be influenced by the need to cope with abuse-related PTSD symptoms. Clinicians should consider using trauma-informed interventions when working with tobacco-using pregnant women.
28762206	The retroviral vector family: something for everyone.	After 30 years of retroviral vector research it became clear that the parental viruses can be both friend and foe. Especially human immunodeficiency virus sparked a global pandemic, but could be converted into a versatile tool for cell therapy. For all retroviral genera, the way from virus to vector was similar resulting in split-vector systems based on the separation of the genes needed for vector particle formation and transgene expression. The first gene therapy trials, although clinically effective, revealed the genotoxicity of retroviral vectors caused by insertional mutagenesis. This issue was solved using self-inactivating vectors carrying weaker cellular promoters. Further fine-tuning was able to generate inducible systems. The current toolbox also contains vectors for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells or efficient RNA interference. More recently the application of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing led to the development of genome-wide small guide RNA libraries targeting all human genes and single lentiviral vectors for an easy delivery of Cas9.
29448209	Metagenomic analysis revealed the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in the gut and living environment of freshwater shrimp.	Antibiotic resistance disseminating from animals and their environments is a public issue that poses significant threats to human health. In the present study, the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 15 samples from the guts and related aquaculture environments (water and sediment) of shrimp were investigated. In total, 60 ARGs, 102 ARGs and 67 ARGs primarily belonging to 13, 15 and 15 different types were detected in the shrimp gut, pond water and sediment samples, respectively. Efflux pump and target modification were the predominant resistance mechanisms in all samples. It was found that Aeromonas, Yersinia and Clostridium XlVb were significantly correlated with the distribution of the ARGs. Besides, the relative abundance of ARGs was positively correlated with the levels of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Moreover, variation partitioning analysis showed that MGEs, contributing to 74.46% of the resistome variation, played an important role in the affecting of the antibiotic resistome than the bacterial communities and their joint effects. Collectively, this study provides comprehensive information to better understand the ARG dissemination in aquaculture environments and to improve the ecological management of aquatic ecosystems.
23726670	Association of glucocorticoid and type 1 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors gene variants and risk for depression during pregnancy and post-partum.	Women with postnatal depression (PND) appear to have abnormal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis responses to stress, which might involve a genetic variability component. We investigated association of genetic variants in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1) and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) genes with increased risk for PND. Two hundred pregnant women were recruited prospectively and PND risk was assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during pregnancy and again 2-8 weeks post-natally (CW-GAPND study). The BclI and ER22/23EK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the GR and the haplotype-tagged rs1876828, rs242939 and rs242941 SNPs of the CRHR1 associated with genetic risk to depressive disorders were genotyped. A cut-off score of 10 was used to detect increased risk of PND. Association analysis was carried out in 140 patients that completed the study protocol. The BclI and rs242939 SNPs were over-represented in women with postnatal EPDS score ≥10 with significant allele association (p = 0.011 and <0.001, respectively) and risk ratios of 2.9 (95% CI: 1.2-6.9) for BclI, 4.9 (2-12) for rs242939 and 5.48 (2.13-14.10) for both. The rs242939 SNP was also associated with increased EPDS values during pregnancy. Moreover, the G-G-T haplotype of the CRHR1 was significantly over-represented in patients with high EPDS scores, with risk ratio of 3.22 (95% CI: 1.91-5.42). This is the first evidence that specific SNPs of genes involved in 'stress' responses might contribute in the genetics of high-risk for depression during pregnancy and postpartum.
23326489	Sox2 is an androgen receptor-repressed gene that promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.	Despite advances in detection and therapy, castration-resistant prostate cancer continues to be a major clinical problem. The aberrant activity of stem cell pathways, and their regulation by the Androgen Receptor (AR), has the potential to provide insight into novel mechanisms and pathways to prevent and treat advanced, castrate-resistant prostate cancers. To this end, we investigated the role of the embryonic stem cell regulator Sox2 [SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2] in normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. In the normal prostate, Sox2 is expressed in a portion of basal epithelial cells. Prostate tumors were either Sox2-positive or Sox2-negative, with the percentage of Sox2-positive tumors increasing with Gleason Score and metastases. In the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line CWR-R1, endogenous expression of Sox2 was repressed by AR signaling, and AR chromatin-IP shows that AR binds the enhancer element within the Sox2 promoter. Likewise, in normal prostate epithelial cells and human embryonic stem cells, increased AR signaling also decreases Sox2 expression. Resistance to the anti-androgen MDV3100 results in a marked increase in Sox2 expression within three prostate cancer cell lines, and in the castration-sensitive LAPC-4 prostate cancer cell line ectopic expression of Sox2 was sufficient to promote castration-resistant tumor formation. Loss of Sox2 expression in the castration-resistant CWR-R1 prostate cancer cell line inhibited cell growth. Up-regulation of Sox2 was not associated with increased CD133 expression but was associated with increased FGF5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 5) expression. These data propose a model of elevated Sox2 expression due to loss of AR-mediated repression during castration, and consequent castration-resistance via mechanisms not involving induction of canonical embryonic stem cell pathways.
21070571	Robotic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for bladder cancer with increased nodal yield.	STUDY TYPE: Therapy (case series). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The standard of care for invasive bladder cancer is open radical cystectomy with the extent of pelvic lymph node dissection impacting oncological outcomes. Scepticism remains regarding whether an adequate node dissection can be performed in minimally-invasive fashion as previously reported nodal yields of laparoscopic or robotic lymphadenectomy are well below those reported with open surgery. This study demonstrates that extended pelvic lymphadenectomy can be performed robotically with equivalent nodal yields to open series from centres of excellence. OBJECTIVE: To report our initial experience with robot-assisted extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) using a standardized open template. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 15 consecutive patients underwent robotic radical cystectomy at a single center by a single surgeon using a standard dissection template. Operating time, time to perform ePLND, pathological stage, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, number of nodes obtained and nodal positivity were assessed. Postoperative complications and re-admissions were reviewed. RESULTS: The mean (range) age and body mass index was 66 (46-87) years and 29 (22-43) kg/m2, respectively. The mean (range) operating time and ePLND time was 423 (300-506) min and 107 (66-160) min. Mean (range) estimated blood loss was 160 (50-500) mL. The mean (range) and median length of hospital stay were 3.4 (3-7) days and 3 days, respectively. The mean (range) nodal yield was 41.8 (18-67) nodes, with greater than 25 nodes in 13 patients. Three patients were found to have nodal positivity. Of the fifteen patients, four received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients were re-admitted for postoperative complications within 30 days. There were no complications directly resulting from the ePLND. CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted ePLND at the time of cystectomy can be safely and effectively performed on the robotic platform with comparable nodal yields to open series at centers of excellence for cystectomy. Nodal yields are likely to comprise a factor related to the effort of the surgeon, and not the method by which the lymphadenectomy is performed.
24652656	Primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of cilia structure and function, leading to chronic infections of the respiratory tract, fertility problems and disorders of organ laterality. Making a definitive diagnosis is challenging, utilizing characteristic phenotypes, ciliary functional and ultra-structural defects in addition to newer screening tools such as nasal nitric oxide and genetic testing. There are 21 known PCD causing genes and in the future, comprehensive genetic testing may help diagnosis young infants prior to developing symptoms thus improving survival. Therapy includes surveillance of pulmonary function and microbiology in addition to, airway clearance, antibiotics and early referral to bronchiectasis centers. Standardized care at specialized centers using a multidisciplinary approach is likely to improve outcomes. In conjunction with the PCD foundation and lead investigators and clinicians are developing a network of PCD clinical centers to coordinate the effort in North America and Europe. As the network grows, care and knowledge will undoubtedly improve.
20198116	3D RESOLUTION MEASURE FOR MULTIFOCAL PLANE MICROSCOPY.	The distance separating two biomolecules in close proximity is an important determinant of the nature of their interaction. While much focus has been given to resolving distances in 2D, the 3D cell in which biological interactions occur necessitates the evaluation of resolution in 3D. Recently, we introduced an information-theoretic 3D resolution measure which predicts that the resolution of an optical microscope is unlimited, and that it improves as more photons are detected from the imaged molecules. Here, we investigate the 3D resolution measure for a multifocal plane microscope. Used for the simultaneous imaging of distinct focal planes within a specimen, multifocal plane microscopy has important applications in the tracking of microscopic objects in 3D. By comparing their 3D resolution measures, we determine the circumstances under which a two-plane microscope setup offers better resolvability than a comparable conventional microscope.
27198858	Frontal fibrosing alopecia: reflections and hypotheses on aetiology and pathogenesis.	Since first described by Kossard in 1994, frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) has been something of an enigma. The clinical heterogeneity of FFA, its apparent rarity and investigators' suboptimal access to phenotypically consistent patient cohorts may all have had a negative impact on delineating disease pathogenesis. Moreover, there is a relative paucity of epidemiological, interventional and basic research studies, and there have been no advances in translational therapeutics, unlike for other inflammatory dermatoses, such as alopecia areata (AA). Dermatologists anecdotally describe an increasing incidence in FFA over the last decade, which has led to the notion that the disorder may be induced by unknown environmental triggers. On the other hand, segregation of FFA in some families lends support to an unexplored genetic element implicated in disease pathogenesis. We herein review what is known about the pathobiology of FFA and formulate working hypotheses to advance insight into this intriguing hair disorder.
28369676	Transcriptome-wide Identification of RNA-binding Protein Binding Sites Using Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP).	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) mediate important co- and post-transcriptional gene regulation by binding pre-mRNA in a sequence- and/or structure-specific manner. For a comprehensive understanding of RBP function, transcriptome-wide mapping of the RNA-binding sites is essential, and CLIP-seq methods have been developed to elucidate protein/RNA interactions at high resolution. CLIP-seq combines protein/RNA UV-crosslinking with immunoprecipitation (CLIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing of crosslinked RNA fragments. To overcome the limitations of low RNA-protein crosslinking efficiency in standard CLIP-seq, photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP) has been developed. Here, living cells or whole organisms are fed photo-activatable nucleoside analogs that are incorporated into nascent RNA transcripts before UV treatment. This allows greater crosslinking efficiency at comparable radiation doses for enhanced RNA recovery and separation of crosslinked target RNA fragments from background RNA degradation products. Moreover, it facilitates the generation of specific UV-induced mutations that mark the crosslinking nucleotide and allow transcriptome-wide identification of RBP binding sites at single-nucleotide resolution. © by 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
23952532	Gene networks controlling Arabidopsis thaliana flower development.	The formation of flowers is one of the main models for studying the regulatory mechanisms that underlie plant development and evolution. Over the past three decades, extensive genetic and molecular analyses have led to the identification of a large number of key floral regulators and to detailed insights into how they control flower morphogenesis. In recent years, genome-wide approaches have been applied to obtaining a global view of the gene regulatory networks underlying flower formation. Furthermore, mathematical models have been developed that can simulate certain aspects of this process and drive further experimentation. Here, we review some of the main findings made in the field of Arabidopsis thaliana flower development, with an emphasis on recent advances. In particular, we discuss the activities of the floral organ identity factors, which are pivotal for the specification of the different types of floral organs, and explore the experimental avenues that may elucidate the molecular mechanisms and gene expression programs through which these master regulators of flower development act.
